# Model routing reference

Every command here classifies its own task before doing real work, and that classification decides how much grilling depth and authoring rigor the rest of the run applies — and, for three commands, whether the session itself must be running on Opus. This page covers the four things a user can observe or influence about that; the full policy — including the mechanics agents don't need restated here — lives in `workflows-core:model-routing/classification`, named again at the end.

## What gets classified

| Class | Plain meaning |
|---|---|
| `SIMPLE` | Trivial, mechanical, low blast radius. |
| `MODERATE` | A localized brief or requirement set, well-understood, no unusual scope. |
| `SIGNIFICANT` | Multi-repo, cross-cutting, or an unusually large requirement/slice count. |
| `HIGH-RISK` | Security-, data-, or contract-sensitive — a mistake here misdirects the product itself. |

All fourteen commands in this plugin load the `model-routing` skill, run this classification as an early step, and state their class plus a one-line reason: `/idea`, `/create-prd`, `/update-prd`, `/create-ard`, `/specify`, `/epics`, `/brd-intake`, `/prd-ground`, `/brd-split`, `/brd-interview`, `/brd-package`, `/brd-reconcile`, `/prd-proposal`, and `/brd-proposal`. Each command has a typical class for its own kind of work (a Product Requirements Document authoring run is typically `MODERATE`; an unusually large BRD requirement count or slice fan-out is typically `SIGNIFICANT`) but escalates when the task in front of it warrants it.

## What classification changes

`SIMPLE` and `MODERATE` continue on whatever model the session is already running, with nothing extra added on their account.

`SIGNIFICANT` and `HIGH-RISK` change different things depending on which command you're running, because two distinct patterns share this classification here:

- **The reviewer-gated authoring commands** — `/create-prd`, `/update-prd`, `/create-ard`, `/specify`, `/epics`, `/prd-ground`, `/brd-package`, `/prd-proposal`, and `/brd-proposal` — already run their own reviewer agent on Opus by a fixed frontmatter pin (`prd-reviewer`, `ard-reviewer`, `spec-reviewer`, `epic-reviewer`, `grounding-verifier`, `brd-package-reviewer`, and `proposal-reviewer` respectively — seven pinned agents across nine commands, since `/create-prd` and `/update-prd` share one and the two proposal commands share another), regardless of classification. What classification changes here is grill depth and authoring rigor, not whether the review runs on Opus — [Agents reference](agents.md) carries the complete list of which agents are pinned and which commands dispatch them.
- **`/idea` has no reviewer at all** — its bounded grill (`--deep` for relentless) is the gate, and classification affects how relentlessly it walks the design tree rather than which agent gets dispatched.
- **`/brd-intake`, `/brd-split`, `/brd-interview`, and `/brd-reconcile` dispatch no Opus-pinned reviewer either** — the first is a mechanical Sonnet-tier extraction, and the other three are interactive/interview commands whose only Opus-tier work, where any exists, is a reviewer another command in the route already ran. Classification here governs analysis depth (how thoroughly the defect walk, the allocation walk, or the reconciliation sweep is carried out), not a review gate.

**Three commands add a further, stricter gate** — `/create-ard`, `/prd-proposal`, and `/brd-proposal`. At `SIGNIFICANT`/`HIGH-RISK` none of the three will author against a weaker model: each gates on whether an Opus tier is reachable at all, because in all three the authoring happens inline, on the session's own model, rather than through a delegated sub-agent. If none is reachable, the run stops and offers to relaunch on Opus, with an explicit override to proceed anyway that gets logged in the final report. `/specify` and `/create-prd` don't gate this way on the same classification — they degrade to the best available model and record the degradation instead of stopping.

## What floors a classification

**Four of the fourteen commands here floor their classification at `SIGNIFICANT`, and all four floor for the same kind of reason** — what the run *produces or changes*, never how much of it there was to read. Four out of fourteen sharing one reason is a pattern in this plugin, not an exception:

- **`/prd-proposal` and `/brd-proposal`** — the run produces a number a customer will make a commercial decision on, and the format's own [residual-risk rule](proposal-format.md#the-risk-the-format-cannot-remove) states it plainly: a plausible number with a defensible-looking argument is more dangerous than an obviously rough one. An umbrella compounds it, because a reader checking one is checking a roll-up rather than a derivation.
- **`/brd-package`** — the adversarial self-review's own output gates the run (a self-review that finds nothing is a rubber stamp), and the rendered prompt is the one artifact this plugin produces that somebody outside the organisation reads with nobody present to correct it.
- **`/brd-reconcile`** — the run freezes customer authority into the decision register, and its propagation sweep writes dispositions into registers belonging to BRDs the run was never pointed at.

**None of the four is about size.** A one-package tier-1 proposal floors exactly as a programme umbrella does, and a two-question reconciliation exactly as a fifty-question one. All four still escalate to `HIGH-RISK` where their own subject warrants it. What the floor then costs differs: for `/prd-proposal` and `/brd-proposal` it combines with the stricter gate above, so both need an Opus session or an explicit, logged override, while `/brd-package` and `/brd-reconcile` degrade to the best available model and record the degradation instead of stopping.

**One command floors on its input instead, and it is the only one.** `/prd-ground` floors at `SIGNIFICANT` when Phase 1 resolved more than one repository — the same multi-source rule the companion `dev-workflows` plugin's `/implement` applies, cited by name in `/prd-ground`'s own Phase 2. So the distinction worth carrying is narrower than "nothing here floors on input": what is never a floor is **the address**. A PRD, an Epic, or a BRD is always a single addressed item, and addressing one is not a multi-source trigger — which is why `/idea` says outright that even a `--ground-code` run does not floor. What can be multi-source is how many repositories a grounding pass touches, and in the one command where that changes the risk, the floor is written down.

## The fallback chain

Every `SIGNIFICANT`/`HIGH-RISK` Opus step resolves against the same ordered list, taking the first model available in the environment:

1. `claude-opus-5`
2. `claude-opus-4-8`
3. `claude-opus-4-7`
4. `claude-opus-4-6`
5. `claude-sonnet-5` (fallback only — the report notes that no Opus was available)
6. `claude-sonnet-4-6` (further fallback)
7. `claude-sonnet-4-5` (further fallback — the report notes "no Opus or Sonnet 5/4.6 available")

`claude-sonnet-4-5` is the floor. If nothing in the list is available, the run stops and asks how to proceed rather than silently downgrading. You never pick a model for any of this yourself — the orchestrator resolves the chain automatically against what your environment has available, and every downgrade from the top of the chain is announced in the run's own report rather than happening quietly.

The full policy — the classification triggers in detail, the `model_routing` handoff block, the mid-tier detection chain used for mechanical steps, and the mandatory Opus code-review checklist — is authoritative in `workflows-core:model-routing/classification`, a reference the companion `workflows-core` plugin ships rather than this one. This page is a summary of it, not a substitute for it.
