name: brd-proposal
description: Programme effort-proposal workflow (PM phase, BRD-route only, optional and ungated) — author the umbrella proposal for a BRD- container by rolling up its slices' own proposals. Enumerates slices by the positive brd-link.md parent test, walks each to a computed recommendation (stop and price it, exclude and disclose it, or re-run a stale one), and gates on each included slice's proposal.md being on the default branch. The roll-up is not a sum: cross-slice effort that exists in no slice is added and named, work two slices priced from the same verified finding is flagged for the operator rather than counted twice, and peak concurrency is computed from the programme schedule instead of summing FTE. Computes coverage from the root coverage ledger and enumerates the remainder by identifier. Carries no money for human hours. Nothing downstream reads a proposal or waits on one.

Author the programme-level effort proposal for the resolved BRD container: $ARGUMENTS

**Core references.** A citation of the form `workflows-core:<name>` names a shared reference in the `workflows-core` plugin. Load it with `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "<name>")` — never by path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to this plugin, which does not carry it.

`/brd-proposal` is the **programme effort-proposal step** (PM phase) — it takes one `BRD-` container and
writes the document a vendor sends a customer for the whole programme, by rolling each slice's own
`proposal.md` into one. It prices nothing itself: every slice's hours were computed by
`/product-workflows:prd-proposal` on that slice, and this run reads them. The canonical shape of both
artifacts — their section sets, the two identifier namespaces, the readiness tiers, the confidence
grades, the closed evidence set, and §14's umbrella rules — is
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md`. This command executes that file; it never
restates it.

Usage: `/brd-proposal <ADDRESS> [--no-brief] [--profile] [--redo]`

**`/brd-proposal`'s natural altitude is the root**, joining `/brd-intake` and `/brd-split` — the
route's other four commands, `/prd-ground`, `/brd-interview`, `/brd-package` and `/brd-reconcile`,
each refuse a container and demand a slice, and this one inverts that. It takes no `--baseline`: a
prior estimate reconciles against the slice that was estimated, not against the umbrella over it.

`<ADDRESS>` resolves through `workflows-core:addressing` §3 `resolve-address`, taken **after**
`$SPECS_PATH` is settled — a resolution taken before the variable is known returns `absent` for a
folder that exists, which is the ordering `/create-prd` and `/create-ard` state for the same reason.

**This command gates nothing on the build ladder and nothing on it waits.** It gates its own input —
each included slice's `proposal.md` — and nothing beyond it. **No command of the build ladder reads a
proposal**, and nothing reads the umbrella this run writes: `/create-ard`, `/specify`, `/epics`,
`/dev-workflows:design`, `/dev-workflows:implement` and `/dev-workflows:ready` each resolve a slice
folder and neither know nor care whether anything above it holds a proposal, and no readiness tier
withholds permission to build. **The umbrella offers no forward advance** — it is the end of this
branch, not a phase in the build ladder. A proposal is a document a vendor sends a customer.

**No money for human hours, at any tier, under any flag** — no rate, no currency symbol, no monetary
total, in either artifact or in the profile
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §1). The USD figures this run emits at the end
are model spend and are a different quantity.

**Both artifacts are prose, and prose is never hard-wrapped** — one unbroken line per paragraph,
per `workflows-core:prose-formatting`, so a straight copy-paste into a review tool or a message needs
no cleanup. This governs what the *run* writes; this command file itself stays wrapped like its
neighbours.

**There is no writer agent, and that is deliberate.** The umbrella is authored inline by this command,
exactly as `/prd-proposal` authors the slice proposal: the authoring *is* the command's purpose, and a
handoff to a writer would only add a place for the resolved data set to be lost between derivation and
rendering.

**This command takes no `--no-docs` and does no documentation grounding at all. That is a decision,
not an omission.** `docs-grounder` retrieves shipped product-documentation pages, which bear on how a
feature is described and not at all on what it costs to build — and this run's inputs are narrower
still: the slice proposals, the root ledger and the profile. There is no flag to turn off, no
`resolve-docs-grounding` call, and no `docs grounding:` line in this command's report.

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve the address, preflight, and refuse a slice

**Parse the flags before anything counts a positional token**, so a flag is never read as the address.
`--no-brief`, `--profile` and `--redo` are boolean; strip all three from `$ARGUMENTS` first, and what
remains is the single positional `<ADDRESS>`. Without this rung the flags this command documents do
not work: a flag is a token, so `--redo` would arrive as the address.

1. **`$SPECS_PATH` (required).** If unset, stop naming `SPECS_PATH`, per the
   `Required path environment variable unset` rule in `workflows-core:escalation-rules`:
   `choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]`.

2. **Specs-repo preflight.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git specs-preflight")`
   and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline, as early as `$SPECS_PATH` is known and
   **before** Phase 4's gate — `require-on-main` performs no fetch of its own
   (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.2) and relies on this step's best-effort one. Prompt-free and
   silent when the specs repo is clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5
   notice; if it returns `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag for the whole run — the
   terminal `commit-artifacts` step skips on it.

3. **Resolve the address.** Resolve the single positional `<ADDRESS>` — a `<KEY>`, or an `@<path>`
   naming a folder — with `resolve-address` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3).
   A key that fails §1's grammar stops with
   `BRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_KEY: /brd-proposal needs an address (^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*(-\d+)+$, e.g. PRODUCT-1234) — re-run '/product-workflows:brd-proposal <ADDRESS>'.`
   Shape only, and never checked against anything (§1) — a key names a folder in `$SPECS_PATH`.
   `status: absent` stops with
   `BRD_PROPOSAL_NOT_FOUND: no folder found for <KEY> under $SPECS_PATH/specifications/ (every level addressing.md §3 bounds, plus §5's legacy fallback) — /brd-proposal prices an existing BRD container and creates none.`
   This command creates no folder in the specs tree.

4. **Refuse a `PRD-` slice**, structurally, **on the directory prefix, before any file inside the
   folder is read**. The umbrella aggregates slices; pricing one is the sibling's job, and the two
   are different documents priced from different inputs.

   **The test is the directory prefix, never the folder's asserted `kind:`** — `/brd-split` writes
   `kind: brd` into the `brd-link.md` inside the `PRD-` slice folder it carves, so a slice *asserts*
   `brd` while being exactly the folder this command must refuse; an asserted-kind gate would accept
   every slice and refuse nothing, which is this command's inversion of the mistake the family's
   other container gates guard against. Where the folder resolved through
   `workflows-core:addressing` §5's legacy unprefixed fallback there is no prefix to test: answer the
   question by the positive-evidence test in
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1 — the shared authority the
   family's container refusals already cite, and not restated here. A legacy folder that fails that
   test is a slice or an idea-route PRD folder either way, and takes the same stop.

   Read `<PARENT-KEY>` from this folder's own `brd-link.md` `parent:` field where it carries one, and
   name it in the stop; where it carries none, say so rather than inventing a parent. Stop:

   ```
   BRD_PROPOSAL_NOT_A_CONTAINER: <ADDRESS> resolves to a PRD- folder at <path>, and the umbrella aggregates slices rather than pricing one.

     For this slice:              /product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>
     For the programme above it:  /product-workflows:brd-proposal <PARENT-KEY>   (read from brd-link.md's parent:, or absent where this folder has none)
   ```

5. **Note whether this run is a revision**, last: whether `proposal.md` and `proposal-brief.md`
   already exist in the resolved folder. Where either does, Phase 6 treats the prior as the anchor
   (§8) unless `--redo` was given, Phase 8 archives it (§2), and §4's section 23 renders (§12).

**Nothing gates on `prd.md`, `ard.md` or `specification.md` here, and there is nothing at this
altitude for such a gate to find**: a `BRD-` container holds none of the three — they are authored in
the `PRD-` slice folders under it. What the umbrella gates is each included slice's `proposal.md`
(Phase 4), and what it grades is the tier those slices already carry (Phase 6).

`/brd-proposal` is **cwd-agnostic**: it reads the resolved folder, its slices and the profile, and
opens no code repository at any point. Every commit any grounding finding cites was pinned by
`/prd-ground`, and a slice's own proposal already resolved it.

---

## Phase 1 — Classify + model routing

Invoke the `model-routing` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "workflows-core:model-routing"`), then record:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK   # SIGNIFICANT is the floor here; see the reason below
  reason: <one-line>
  current_model: <the model this orchestrator/grill is running under>
  detection_model: <§2.1 Sonnet chain: claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6/4-5>   # impl-maintenance
  review_model:    <§2 Opus chain>     # proposal-reviewer (frontmatter-pinned; recorded, no override)
  authoring_model: <= current_model>   # the profile grill + both artifacts (session model, not a delegated subagent)
  opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
  notes: <any §2/§2.1 fallback or degradation>
```

**`SIGNIFICANT` is the floor, and the reason is a property of the output rather than of the input
size.** This run produces the number a customer makes a commercial decision on for an entire
programme, assembled from several slices' own documents, and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §13 states the residual risk plainly: a
plausible number with a defensible-looking argument is more dangerous than an obviously rough one. An
umbrella compounds that, because a reader who checks it is checking a roll-up rather than a
derivation. Escalate to `HIGH-RISK` where the programme's own state warrants it — a slice excluded
that a reader will expect to be there, a de-duplication flag the operator resolved against the
obvious reading.

**Tiered HARD model gate.** For `SIGNIFICANT` / `HIGH-RISK`, require an Opus session — if
`opus_available` is false, stop:
`choices: ["I'll relaunch /product-workflows:brd-proposal on Opus (Recommended)", "Override — proceed on the current model (logged in the final report)", "Cancel"]`.

---

## Phase 2 — Enumerate the slices

**The enumeration is the positive test and nothing else.** List every immediate subdirectory of the
resolved BRD folder that **contains a `brd-link.md` carrying a `parent:` field naming this BRD** —
exactly the test `commands/brd-split.md` Phase 0 defines and for exactly its reason: **a name match
is not the test**, and matching by name then reading an absent `brd-link.md` as an empty claim list
is what lets a folder that is not a child be counted as one. The test also needs no exclusion list,
since `brd/`, `grounding/` and `dev-workflows/` carry no `brd-link.md` at all.

Record, per slice: its key, its folder, whether `proposal.md` and `proposal-brief.md` are present,
and the modification times of `proposal.md` against `prd.md`, `decisions.md` and the files under
`grounding/` — Phase 3 walks that record and decides nothing here.

Zero slices stops — there is no roll-up over an empty set, and a programme total computed from
nothing would read as a real figure:

```
BRD_PROPOSAL_NO_SLICES: <BRD-KEY> at <path> has no slices — nothing has been carved from it, so there is nothing to roll up.
  Carve them first: /product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY> "<how to cut it>"
```

---

## Phase 3 — The readiness walk

Walk every slice Phase 2 enumerated, one at a time, and **carry a computed recommendation for each —
the decision stays the operator's**. Three states, and the recommendation each one computes to:

| Slice state | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| no `proposal.md`, and the slice grades tier ≥ 2 | **Stop.** Run `/product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>` first — the slice is estimable, and excluding it understates the programme |
| no `proposal.md`, and the slice grades tier 1 or holds no `prd.md` | **Exclude, and disclose.** Nothing better is available today, and stopping buys nothing |
| `proposal.md` present but older than the slice's own `prd.md`, `decisions.md` or grounding files | **Re-run it.** The common case, and the easiest to miss |

Grade a slice's tier against `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §5's ladder, over
that slice's own folder — the same grading `/prd-proposal` Phase 3 performs, applied here only to
decide which of the three rows a slice is in.

**Always print the computed recommendation beside the array**, so the operator reads the run's
judgement and the available answers separately: the printed line is what carries the judgement, and an
option's wording is never the only place it appears. **An option may still offer the recommendation's
own action**, and the first array below does — where an answer would otherwise reach no defined path,
giving it an option is what gives it one, and that row says so where it does it. For a slice whose
`proposal.md` is on disk but stale:

```
choices: ["Include it as it stands", "Re-price it first — /product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>, then re-run the umbrella", "Exclude it, and disclose the exclusion in the coverage statement"]
```

**The middle option is this row's own computed recommendation, and it is an option rather than only a
printed line** because a stale proposal is the one row where the run's judgement is *"re-run it"* and
the operator has no way to say yes. Without it the free-text option is where that answer would land,
and a typed *"re-run it"* reaches no defined path. It ends the run on exactly the path
**"Price the slice first"** takes below — finish the walk, write nothing, name what is still to
price — because re-pricing and first-pricing leave the umbrella in the same state: waiting on a slice
run. Nothing is excluded by it and no membership is recorded for that slice.

For a slice holding **no `proposal.md` at all** — the first two rows above — the array differs, and it
differs for one reason: there is nothing to include, so an option offering to include it is one the
run cannot honour. The recommendation printed beside it is what tells the two rows apart:

```
choices: ["Price the slice first — /product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>, then re-run the umbrella", "Exclude it, and disclose the exclusion in the coverage statement"]
```

**"Price the slice first" and "Re-price it first" both end the run**, on one path. They are the two
answers in this walk that are not membership decisions, so neither is recorded as one: finish the walk
so the operator sees the whole picture, then end before Phase 4, naming **every** slice still to price
and writing no artifact at all — no `proposal.md`, no brief, no archive, no handoff. Neither excludes
anything. This is an operator's finished decision rather than a refusal, so it carries no stop id and
runs the emitter tail (Phase 13) on the way out, exactly as a completed run does; the final report
says which slices it is waiting on. Treating it as an exclusion would produce the understated umbrella
this row's **Stop** recommendation exists to prevent, and would record the operator as having chosen
an exclusion they did not choose.

Neither array's wording is adjusted per slice: `<SLICE-KEY>` is a substitution, and the row's own
recommendation is printed beside the array (`workflows-core:escalation-rules`, *Choice lists are
presented verbatim*). An operator who excludes a slice the walk recommended pricing is making a
decision the document must record: **every exclusion, and every inclusion taken against the walk's
recommendation, is named in the final report and enumerated in the coverage statement** (Phase 7).

**Nothing here re-prices a slice, re-derives its hours, or edits its proposal**, the two
run-ending answers included: each of those ends the run and leaves the re-pricing to a
`/product-workflows:prd-proposal` run the operator starts. Every other answer this walk takes is a
membership decision and nothing else.

---

## Phase 4 — Gate the included slices

Execute `require-on-main` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff require-on-main")`, §3)
against **each included slice's `proposal.md`**, and only those — an excluded slice is not gated,
because nothing of it enters the roll-up.

**Map `stopped` before `on_main`**, per §3's own rule: `on_main: absent` is returned by row F alone,
and a caller that branches on `absent` first cannot tell row F from rows D/E. `pass` → include;
`pass_amending` → include, printing the §3.3 row-B message; `unmanaged` → include; any stopping row →
collect it.

**Run the gate over every included slice before stopping on any of them.** A programme of six slices
whose proposals are all unmerged should be one stop naming six, not six runs each naming one. Emit one
stop at the end of the sweep, carrying §4.4's four parts for **every** slice that stopped: a slice on
rows D/E names the concrete branch and pull-request state the gate reported for it, and the slices
that came back row F — the proposal is on no ref the eight prefixes name — collect into:

```
BRD_PROPOSAL_SLICE_NOT_HANDED_OFF: these included slices have a proposal.md on disk that is on no ref — <keys> — so the umbrella would roll up numbers no later reader can reproduce.
  Land each one, or re-run this command and exclude it.
```

**A slice with no `proposal.md` at all never reaches this gate**: Phase 3 already decided whether to
stop for it or exclude it, so row F here means *written and not handed off* and nothing else. That
split is recorded as this command's row in `workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.4.

---

## Phase 5 — The proposal profile

The profile is this command's only input that is neither in the resolved folder nor in a slice under
it, and it is **the same file `/prd-proposal` reads**, at
`$SPECS_PATH/.dev-workflows/proposal-profile.yml` — one team, one productivity basis and one
engagement model across the programme and every slice in it. `/prd-proposal` Phase 2 owns its shape;
this run reads it rather than defining a second one.

**How the profile is obtained, in three states** — the same three, for the same reasons:

- **Absent** — grill it into existence (`workflows-core:grilling-technique`), field by field, and
  write it. `engagement_model` **restructures the engagement-governance, change-control and
  priced-options sections wholesale** (§4 sections 16, 17 and 18), so it is asked rather than assumed:
  `choices: ["time-and-material", "fixed-price"]`.
- **Present** — **show it back for confirmation, every run, never read silently.** A productivity
  basis captured once and never revisited silently mis-scales every later proposal, which is the
  second of the two limits `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §13 states:
  `choices: ["Use it as shown (Recommended)", "Correct a field — I'll say which", "Re-grill the whole profile"]`.
- **`--profile`** — re-grill it in full regardless of what is on disk, then continue the run.

**`engagement_model` is a closed vocabulary here too, and for a stronger reason: this run reads the
same committed file every slice was priced under.** A free-text answer to either picker — the grill's
own, or a `"Correct a field — I'll say which"` answer naming `engagement_model` — is normalised into
`time-and-material` or `fixed-price`, or the question is re-asked; it is never written through as a
third value (`workflows-core:escalation-rules`, *Closed-vocabulary pickers must normalise the
free-text answer*, whose table carries this picker). §0 of that file makes the free-text option
unconditional, so the array cannot protect the field by omitting one, and §4 sections 16, 17 and 18
have only the two shapes to render.

A run that cannot obtain a profile at all — the grill was cancelled, or the file cannot be written —
stops:
`BRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_PROFILE: no proposal profile at $SPECS_PATH/.dev-workflows/proposal-profile.yml, and none was captured. Re-run with --profile to author one; an effort proposal cannot state a team, a schedule or a productivity basis without it.`

**Where a correction moves a field the included slices were priced under** — the productivity basis,
`hours_per_developer_day`, `calendar.hours_per_week` — **say so and do not re-derive their hours**:
this run never re-prices a slice (§14). Name the affected slices in the report and recommend
re-running `/product-workflows:prd-proposal` on each; the umbrella's own figures use the corrected
profile from here on.

**No rates, no currency, no money in this file** — the same rule that binds both artifacts
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §1). A profile carrying one is reported and
the value is not read.

---

## Phase 6 — The roll-up and its three adjustments

Execute `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §14, which owns the umbrella's row set,
**how §7's two always-present packages and its defect sweep read at programme altitude**, the three
adjustments, the tier rule, the range rule and the de-duplication check with its disclosed limit.
This phase performs all of them; it does not re-express any of them.

1. **Build the row set** — one row per included slice, carrying that slice's hours, its range, its
   tier and its confidence, read from that slice's own `proposal.md` and **never re-derived** (§14).
   A figure this run cannot read out of a slice proposal is a stop-shaped defect in that proposal,
   not a number to reconstruct. **It is not this phase's to settle either**: excluding the slice here
   would reverse the membership decision Phase 3 reserved to the operator and would reach the
   coverage statement Phase 7 computes, so put the two outcomes to them, quoting what could not be
   read and from where:
   `choices: ["Exclude it, and disclose the exclusion in the coverage statement", "End the run — re-price it with /product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>, then re-run the umbrella"]`
   The second answer ends the run on the same path Phase 3's two run-ending answers take: finish
   nothing, write no artifact, name the slice in the report. The first is an exclusion like any
   other, and Phase 3's rule applies to it unchanged — it is named in the final report and
   enumerated in the coverage statement, together with the reason it was excluded here rather than
   in the walk.
2. **The umbrella's own work packages** — §7's two always-present packages read at programme altitude
   (§14), and §14's first adjustment, the umbrella effort, beside them. §14 fixes which is which;
   this step mints all of their `[WP#n]`s in the umbrella's own contiguous series (§3), grades each
   one's confidence per §6 with a stated reason, and carries the drivers behind them as the
   umbrella's own `[ED#n]`s under §8's closed evidence set. **A discovery-and-design package is
   present here as it is in every proposal** (§7), and rendering §4 section 6 without one is the
   defect this step exists to prevent.
3. **The defect sweep, over the container and no further** (§14, §7). Sweep §7's three sources as
   they exist at *this* level — the container's own records — and confirm each candidate §7 marks as
   needing it, one at a time, quoting the record's own text so the operator rules on it rather than
   on a summary:
   `choices: ["Confirm — an unrepaired code defect this engagement would repair", "Reject — already repaired, or not the vendor's to repair"]`
   A confirmed defect takes its own `[WP#n]` and never renders in §4's section 18 (§7). **A slice's
   sources are not swept again** — §14 says why, and each slice's confirmed defects are already
   priced inside its row. **Report what the sweep found either way**, including that it found
   nothing, which is the ordinary outcome: a container normally holds no `grounding/`, no
   `code-defect-log.md` and no packaged self-review, because all three are slice-level artifacts.
4. **De-duplication** — §14's second adjustment, and the one with an operator decision in it. Read
   every included slice's `[ED#n]` table, index the evidence identifiers it cites, and flag every
   identifier claimed by more than one included slice. Present each flag with both slices' driver rows
   quoted verbatim, so the operator rules on the record rather than on a summary of it:
   `choices: ["Genuinely two pieces of work — keep both", "One piece of work priced twice — deduct it, and name the deduction"]`
   §14 fixes what a deduction is and what the document must disclose about the check's own limit;
   render both.
5. **Sequencing** — §14's third adjustment. Compute peak concurrency from the programme schedule,
   taking slice order from `depends_on` in each slice's PRD frontmatter.
6. **The umbrella's tier** is §14's minimum-and-print-the-mix rule; every package this phase minted
   of its own (steps 2 and 3) is capped by §5's ceiling for that minimum tier.
7. **Re-estimate gates for the umbrella's own packages** — §4's section 8, derived here and not
   anywhere else. §6 makes a declared gate **mandatory** at Low, and step 6's ceiling makes Low the
   common outcome rather than an edge: the umbrella's tier is the minimum of its included slices',
   so a single tier-1 slice caps every package this phase minted at Low. Give each such package a
   gate naming its trigger event, and offer the no-hours commitment **per gate, never by default**,
   exactly as `/product-workflows:prd-proposal` Phase 6 step 5 does at slice altitude:
   `choices: ["Declare the gate only — a re-estimate promise", "Add the no-implementation-hours-before-the-gate commitment"]`
   **At tier 1 the document-level gate is the umbrella's own** (§5, §14): its trigger is §5's — what
   capped each of them — applied per included slice whose tier set the minimum and named by key
   rather than left as "the slice", because the umbrella grades no folder of its own. A slice's own
   gates stay inside that slice's row and are not restated here (§14) — this step declares gates only
   for the `[WP#n]`s steps 2 and 3 minted.
8. **Sum the ranges and state them as summed** (§14).
9. **Apply §8's stability rule** on a re-run, against the prior revision Phase 0 noted; §12's
   changelog then names the cause of every figure that moved — including a figure that moved only
   because a slice was re-priced beneath it, which is a cause and is named as one. **`--redo`
   discards the anchor** — say so in the report when it was given, because a run that discarded the
   anchor and a run that never had one are otherwise indistinguishable in the output.

**No money for human hours, at any tier, under any flag** (§1). Every figure this phase produces is
hours.

---

## Phase 7 — Coverage from the root ledger

Execute §14's coverage statement over the resolved BRD's own `coverage-ledger.md`: classify every
row into §14's four classes, reading each row's disposition per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §3, then state the proportion covered
and enumerate the remainder by identifier. §14 owns what each class means and why the enumeration is
by identifier rather than by slice name; this phase performs the classification and renders the
result.

**Which slices count as included is this run's own input to that**, and it is Phase 3's decision
rather than the ledger's: a row `covered-by` a slice the walk excluded is unpriced however the ledger
reads. Carry Phase 3's membership list into the classification, and report the row counts per class
beside the statement.

**Where the resolved folder holds no `coverage-ledger.md` at all**, §14 says the document claims no
proportion; say so in the report as well, so the operator knows the number was withheld rather than
computed as zero.

---

## Phase 8 — Author `proposal.md`

Write `<folder>/proposal.md` — `<folder>` being the resolved BRD folder itself, so §4's section 21
traceability is relative links that resolve rather than names a reader must go and find (§2). Its
links reach down into the slice folders, which is where the priced detail lives.

**Archive the predecessor before overwriting it**, exactly as §2 fixes it: the path under
`revisions/`, the same-day suffix, and the `revision_of:` the new canonical records are all §2's, and
Phase 11 hands off the paths it produced.

**Render §4's twenty-three-row section set, in its order, at umbrella altitude** — §14 fixes what
each section carries at this altitude and what it does not. Two sections are conditional — section 22
never renders here, this command taking no `--baseline`, and section 23 renders only on a revision
(§12) — and **every other section renders, a section with nothing to say saying so rather than being
omitted**. The header block carries the umbrella's readiness tier beside the date, and the mix behind
that tier (§14), so a reader is never handed a programme number without being told what grade of
evidence stands behind it (§2), and it carries the `engagement_model` from the profile.

**Detail stays in the slice proposals**, and §14 fixes what that leaves the umbrella carrying: the
row set, its own umbrella `[WP#n]`s and `[ED#n]`s, aggregated roles, one team, one schedule, the
cross-slice dependency graph, and the coverage statement Phase 7 computed.

Three things the section list makes easy to get wrong at this altitude, each stated because §4 names
them and this run executes them:

- **Section 15 is not section 20** — §9 states what separates them and what conflating them costs.
  At umbrella altitude section 15 additionally carries the de-duplication limit (§14) and every
  slice-level condition that would move the programme band.
- **Section 11's indicative schedule carries peak concurrency, never a sum of FTEs** (§4), which is
  Phase 6's sequencing adjustment rendered.
- **Section 21 cites a requirement in the form the source artifact carries it** (§11), because a
  proposal is read by the **customer**, who wrote those identifiers in their own document in their
  own form. The `[WP#n]` and `[ED#n]` namespaces this run mints are the plugin's own and stay
  bracketed. A conversion in either direction is the defect the reviewer looks for.

Write the whole file as prose that is never hard-wrapped (`workflows-core:prose-formatting`).

---

## Phase 9 — Author `proposal-brief.md`

**Skipped below tier 2, irrespective of `--no-brief`** — §5 fixes that floor and states why it holds
against the flag, and the tier tested here is the umbrella's own (Phase 6), which is the minimum of
its included slices'. Skipped as well at tier ≥ 2 where `--no-brief` was given. **Say which of the
two reasons applied**, in the report — a brief withheld by the tier and a brief withheld by the flag
are different facts about the run.

Otherwise write `<folder>/proposal-brief.md` from **the same resolved data set as the umbrella, never
re-authored from it**, rendering §10's six-row section set. Row 3 does not render here (no
`--baseline`), and rows 2 and 4–6 are drawn from the umbrella and from the slices it included. **A
spine-only brief is a defect, not a shorter brief** (§10): every item in rows 2–6 that the umbrella
carries reaches the brief, and every figure the brief repeats matches the umbrella.

**Archive the prior brief only where this run renders one** (§2) — the prior `proposal-brief.md`
moves to `<folder>/revisions/<KEY>_proposal-brief_<YYYYMMDD>.md` under §2's same-day suffix rule.
Archiving is tied to overwriting, so a run that renders no brief archives none. Where a prior brief
is therefore left standing beside a newly written umbrella, **say so plainly in the final report**:
that file describes the archived revision and not this one.

---

## Phase 10 — Pre-lint, review and triage

**The cheap pass runs before the expensive one.**

1. **Structural pre-lint.** Run the deterministic checks in
   `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "pre-lint")` against both artifacts this run wrote:
   its **Universal checks**, **identifier integrity** over the umbrella's own `[WP#n]` and `[ED#n]`
   series, and **required-section presence** against §4's and §10's section sets. **Its *Auto-link
   collision* check does not run here**, that section being scoped to PRD, ARD and Epic files, and
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §11 records why the exclusion is deliberate
   rather than an oversight to be corrected. Advisory — surface every finding, inline-fix the
   mechanical ones, and proceed; the reviewer is the gate.
2. **The review gate.** Dispatch `proposal-reviewer` (Opus, frontmatter-pinned; recorded as
   `review_model`, no override). **It is the same reviewer the sibling dispatches, unchanged** — its
   check 9 (Coverage) applies on this run and is `N/A` on a slice's, and its check 2 carries an
   umbrella-totals relation for the same reason; nothing else about it differs by folder kind:

   → Agent (subagent_type: "product-workflows:proposal-reviewer", model: `<review_model — §2 Opus chain>`):
     > "Review the effort proposal:
     >
     > Proposal path: [absolute path to proposal.md]
     > Brief path: [absolute path to proposal-brief.md, or 'none — <the reason Phase 9 recorded>']
     > Profile path: [absolute path to proposal-profile.yml]
     > Readiness tier: [1 · Indicative | 2 · Grounded | 3 · Architected | 4 · Specified], capped by [the slice that set the minimum]
     > Anchor revision: [absolute path to the archived prior revision, or 'none — first revision' or 'discarded by --redo']"

3. **Triage before anything is edited.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "finding-triage")`
   and follow it over the reviewer's findings — **the orchestrator runs the triage, never a fixer**.
   Verify each finding's claimed consequence at the location it names, keep or dismiss it, and record
   every dismissal with a reason that disposes of that finding's own claim. There is no silent-drop
   disposition. Fix the surviving BLOCKERs inline (the orchestrator edits both artifacts — there is no
   delegated writer) and re-review **once**; if still `BLOCK`, escalate per the
   `Review verdict BLOCK` rule in
   `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "escalation-rules")`.
   `PASS` / `PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS` → proceed. Cap: one fix cycle plus one re-review. Where triage
   empties the survivor set, do not dispatch a fix cycle with nothing to apply and do not silently
   promote the verdict — the user settles a verdict its own findings no longer support.

**A finding against a slice's own proposal is not fixed here.** This run edits the umbrella and
nothing under it; where a survivor's location is a slice document, record it, name the slice, and
recommend `/product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>` — editing another phase's deliverable from
here would leave that slice's own reviewer verdict standing over content it never saw.

Report findings reviewed, survivors, and every dismissal with its reason: a triage that reports only
survivors is indistinguishable from a reviewer that found less.

---

## Phase 11 — Handoff

Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff")` and present its §4.3 choice array verbatim:

```
choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git (nothing downstream reads this, so no command stops on it)", "Cancel"]
```

**The array above is §4.3's `unread` one, and the class is named here rather than left to be
inferred.** §4.3 asks a producer reaching for it to look for a reader first, so this run looked: no
command of the build ladder reads a proposal, `/prd-proposal` reads only the profile and its own
folder, and the one command that reads a proposal at all — this one — reads a **slice's**, never an
umbrella's. Nothing runs `require-on-main` on this file either, so §4.0's gated test fails as well.
`proposal-brief.md` and the archived revisions travel in the same `deliverable_paths` set and take
that same class with them (§4.0).

On the first choice, execute `handoff-to-main` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff handoff-to-main")`, §2) with `prefix: brd`
(§2.9's table — the shared prefix every `/brd-*` command uses; the eight prefixes §1 rule 3 fixes are
not extended, and nothing about an umbrella makes it a ninth phase), `feature_folder` as resolved in
Phase 0, `deliverable_paths` = `proposal.md`, `proposal-brief.md` where this run rendered one, and, on
a revision, the archived prior under `revisions/` — `<KEY>_proposal_<YYYYMMDD>.md`, and
`<KEY>_proposal-brief_<YYYYMMDD>.md` where a brief was archived beside it,
`title: <BRD-KEY> Programme effort proposal <YYYYMMDD>`, and `body_facts` = the slices included and
the slices excluded, each by key; the umbrella tier with the slice that set it and the tier mix; the
`[WP#n]` count and the total expected hours with its summed range; every named adjustment and what it
came to; the coverage proportion and the count of requirements left unpriced; the `proposal-reviewer`
verdict; and whether a rationale brief was rendered. Emit its §4.1 outcome line in the final report.

---

## Phase 12 — Next steps

**One literal array.** Every printed command name is fully qualified
(`workflows-core:next-phase-offer` rule 6), and every offer in it prints exactly one positional
address (rule 7).

```
choices: ["Stop here — the umbrella is written and, if you handed it off, committed", "Re-price a slice the readiness walk flagged — /product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>", "Re-run the umbrella once those land — /product-workflows:brd-proposal <BRD-KEY>"]
```

**No option carries `<merge-clause>`, and that is derived rather than forgotten.**
`/product-workflows:prd-proposal` runs `require-on-main` against `prd.md`, which this run does not
write, so no downstream gate named here reads anything this run produced; and the third option is
this command itself, whose own gate targets a **slice's** `proposal.md` rather than the umbrella this
run wrote. **The umbrella offers no forward advance** — it is the end of this branch, not a phase in
the build ladder, so there is no next phase to wait on a merge. `<SLICE-KEY>` and `<BRD-KEY>` are
substitutions, not rewordings (`workflows-core:escalation-rules`, *Choice lists are presented
verbatim*).

**Drop the second option where the readiness walk flagged nothing** — no slice excluded, none stale,
none the walk recommended pricing first. Two options remain, which is the minimum `AskUserQuestion`
requires, and the third then reads as the standing re-run offer it is: the umbrella is recomputed
from whatever the slices hold on the day it is run. Nothing is ever added beyond the three above, and
no option's wording is adjusted.

Guidance only — never auto-invokes another command. Per `workflows-core:next-phase-offer`.

### Context hygiene

The resume pointer is written in the terminal cost phase (Phase 13), per
`workflows-core:session-hygiene` §1 — this block prints the guidance only.

- **Re-running the umbrella once a re-priced slice lands?** → run **`/compact`**; the slice row set
  and the coverage classification are still worth keeping.
- **Moving to another BRD?** → run **`/clear`**; both artifacts are on disk and the next run reads
  them from the specs repo, not from this session.
- Consider **`/rename <BRD-KEY>-<slug>-pm`** so you can find this session later.

Guidance only — see `workflows-core:session-hygiene`.

---

## Phase 13 — Session maintenance, feedback & cost

Terminal phase — runs after Phase 12, and NEVER interrupts an earlier phase. The order below is the
canonical emitter tail (`workflows-core:session-hygiene` §5 rule 2): feedback → follow-ups → cost →
`resume.md` → `commit-artifacts`.

**Capture-at-block invariant.** If an EARLIER phase halts on a plugin / skill / command / reference
gap, `emit-block` (per `workflows-core:feedback-emission`) fires at that halt **before** escalating.
**None of this command's own stops qualifies**, and that is the point of naming them here:
`BRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_KEY`, `BRD_PROPOSAL_NOT_FOUND`, `BRD_PROPOSAL_NOT_A_CONTAINER`,
`BRD_PROPOSAL_NO_SLICES`, `BRD_PROPOSAL_SLICE_NOT_HANDED_OFF`, `BRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_PROFILE` and an
unset `$SPECS_PATH` each report the state of the operator's own argument list, tree or environment —
not a capability this plugin lacks. A review BLOCK is not one either: that is the gate working.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (subagent_type: "workflows-core:impl-maintenance", model:
   `<detection_model — §2.1 Sonnet chain>`) with a compact handoff: command `/brd-proposal`; what was
   produced (the umbrella, the brief or the reason there is none, the archived prior); key events (the
   slices included and excluded with the walk's recommendation for each, what the container-level defect
   sweep found, de-duplication flags and how the operator resolved them, the umbrella tier and the
   slice that set it, BLOCK reviews — or 'none'); workarounds; the `proposal-reviewer` verdict; test result N/A; project root = the resolved
   folder.
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "feedback-emission emit-auto")`
   and call its `emit-auto` entry point (§6) with the report, `command: /brd-proposal`, the run's
   `key`, `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`).
   Surface the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted").
3. **Emit follow-up tasks.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "followup-emission")`
   and execute its steps inline over this run's qualifying follow-ups — every slice the walk
   recommended pricing or re-running, every slice excluded from the roll-up, and every de-duplication
   flag the operator left as two pieces of work against the run's own reading, each of which is work
   somebody has to do outside this run. Filter with the reference's §6 predicate, resolve the write
   target via its §4 ladder, dedupe per §5, and preview + confirm per §7. ADDITIVE: the same items
   also stay in the final report.
4. **Session cost (ALWAYS runs).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "cost-emission emit-cost")` and call its `emit-cost` entry point with `command: /brd-proposal`, `phase: proposal`, `role: pm`, the run's `key`, `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Surface the persisted path (or the report-only notice). **This entry records model spend in USD and has no relationship whatever to the human hours the artifacts contain.**
5. **Write the resume pointer.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "session-hygiene")`
   and, per its §1, write/overwrite `<BRD-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` now — after the cost entry
   above, so the pointer reflects the completed run, and before the commit step below, so it is
   included in it. Redact per §1. Silent; the printed `### Context hygiene` guidance already appeared.
6. **Commit session artifacts (terminal).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git commit-artifacts")`
   and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — the LAST action of the run. It stages
   ONLY the §2.1 bounded artifact paths inside `$SPECS_PATH`, commits
   `<KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (/brd-proposal)` with no `Co-Authored-By` trailer, and
   pushes to the branch this run's handoff phase created (§4.1). It NEVER touches anything outside
   `$SPECS_PATH`; NEVER force-pushes; NEVER fails the run; and skips entirely when the run carries
   `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting that notice. Hold its §6 outcome line for the final
   report.

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits the deliverable (git for the deliverable is
offered only in Phase 11; the terminal step above commits only the bounded session-artifact paths in
`$SPECS_PATH`), and NEVER writes into a code repo, a docs repo, or the current working directory; no
user name is ever written.

---

## Final report

Report: the resolved folder and the `BRD-` key; **every slice Phase 2 enumerated, with the walk's
computed recommendation and the operator's decision for each** — included, excluded, or left for
re-pricing — so an inclusion taken against a **Stop** recommendation is visible rather than implied.
**On a run the walk ended** — the operator answered "Price the slice first" — the report is that walk
plus the list of slices still to price, and it says plainly that no artifact was written and nothing
was excluded; the rest of this list describes a run that reached Phase 8. Otherwise:
the `require-on-main` return for each included slice; **the umbrella's readiness tier, the slice that
set it, and the full tier mix**, with the confidence ceiling that tier sets; the row set's totals and
**the programme's expected hours with its summed low and high** (hours, never money), each named
adjustment shown separately rather than absorbed — umbrella effort, every de-duplication deduction
with the finding identifier that produced it, and the sequencing result with its peak concurrency;
every de-duplication flag the operator kept as two pieces of work, with the reason; **what the
container-level defect sweep found** — every candidate confirmed and every one rejected, or that it
found nothing, which is the ordinary outcome; **the coverage
proportion and the count of requirements the umbrella does not cover, by class** — excluded slice,
still `unallocated`, or terminal — with the enumeration itself in §4's coverage statement; whether the
resolved folder held a root ledger at all, and, where it did not, that no proportion is claimed; the
umbrella `[WP#n]` set with each package's confidence grade, and every band that deviates from §6's
default for its grade with its direction and recorded reason; **whether a rationale brief was rendered
and, when it was not, which of the two reasons applied** — the tier, or `--no-brief` — and, where a
prior brief is left standing beside a newly written umbrella, that it describes the archived revision
and not this one; whether this run was a revision, the archived paths, and whether `--redo` discarded
the anchor; the profile's `engagement_model`, whether the profile was read back, corrected or
re-grilled, and any correction that moved a field the included slices were priced under, with the
slices it affects; the pre-lint findings; the `proposal-reviewer` verdict with the triage line —
findings reviewed, survivors, and every dismissal with its reason — and every survivor whose location
was a slice document rather than the umbrella; resolved model routing (+ any Opus gate or
degradation); the feedback, follow-up and cost paths, with the cost line labelled as **model spend in
USD, a different quantity from the hours above**; the `Phase handoff:` outcome line from
`handoff-to-main` (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.1); the `Specs repo:` outcome line from
`commit-artifacts` (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §6), with any guard notice repeated in full; and
the next-step recommendation.

**Say plainly, at the end, that this document gates nothing and that nothing reads it.** No command of
the build ladder reads a proposal, no tier withholds permission to begin work, and nothing — this
command included — reads an umbrella: it is the end of this branch rather than a phase in the ladder.
The residual risk `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §13 states is carried by the
person who sends the document, and that person is the reader of this report.
