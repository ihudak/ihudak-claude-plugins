# workflows-core

Shared foundation for the `dev-workflows` plugin family: the addressing grammar and specs-repo git entry points, phase handoff, model routing, escalation and finding-triage rules, cost/feedback/follow-up emission, and the grounding and grilling conventions every authoring command applies. It also carries six slash commands — the family-meta utilities and `/frames`, the design-frame-set indexer — plus the five agents any plugin in the family may dispatch.

> Part of the `ihudak-plugins` marketplace — see the [repo-root setup guide](../../README.md) for marketplace install + prerequisites.

## What it does

Most of this plugin is not a command at all. It is the corpus a sibling plugin reads: 29 files under `references/`, the `model-routing` skill that resolves the classification rules, and five agents dispatched by name. The six commands it does ship are the ones that belong to no single pipeline — they act on the plugin family itself, or on the specs tree rather than on a phase of it.

| Group | Commands | What it does |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Plugin feedback | [`/feedback`](docs/commands/feedback.md), [`/prompt`](docs/commands/prompt.md), [`/prompt-brainstorm`](docs/commands/prompt-brainstorm.md), [`/prompt-grill-me`](docs/commands/prompt-grill-me.md) | Log friction about the plugin itself, or capture a correction you just made and act on it. |
| Setup | [`/statusline`](docs/commands/statusline.md) | Install the plugin family's multi-line status line into your Claude Code settings. |
| Specs-tree repair | [`/frames`](docs/commands/frames.md) | (Re)build the index every exported design frame set must carry before anything can read it. |

`/statusline` collides with a Claude Code built-in of the same name, so type the qualified `/workflows-core:statusline`.
