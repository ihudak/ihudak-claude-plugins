name: brd-reconcile
description: BRD reconciliation workflow (PM phase, the BRD-to-PRD route's last command). Takes the customer's returned review at whatever path it arrived on, copies it into the BRD folder under the canonical name and commits it before anything reads it, then dispatches customer-review-reader in schema or free-text mode. Confirms every free-text candidate with the operator one at a time against its verbatim quotation before it can become a [CD#n], and never widens the reader's mode. Freezes the confirmed answers as [CD#n] — conditional or open, never unconditionally decided, where every finding an answer rests on is will-change — closes each [C] question with the terminal disposition answered by the customer, applies the review's required corrections, banners superseded dated snapshots instead of rewriting them, writes customer-amended <SLICE-KEY> <date>, withdrawn and resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n] resolutions to the defect log, and moves coverage-ledger rows without touching allocation. Then sweeps every dependent BRD — conditional_on positions first — to inherited-unchanged, reverted, reopened or withdrawn, and sweeps every artifact under the parent for the changed ids and for prose still asserting a superseded position. Writes reconciliation-<YYYYMMDD>.md. Normally gates on the package /brd-package built and handed off; --sent admits a review of a hand-authored or out-of-band package instead, by taking the material the customer was actually sent and committing it beside the review. Takes no --no-docs and does no documentation grounding.

Turn the customer's returned review into frozen decisions, and leave nothing in the tree still
asserting a position it overturned: $ARGUMENTS

**Core references.** A citation of the form `workflows-core:<name>` names a shared reference in the `workflows-core` plugin. Load it with `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "<name>")` — never by path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to this plugin, which does not carry it.

`/brd-reconcile` is the **BRD-to-PRD route's last command** (PM phase) — it takes the
file that came back from the package `/brd-package` sent, freezes what the customer actually decided,
and then goes looking for everything the delivery organisation still believes that their answer has
made false. Its whole discipline is one rule: **a customer decision enters the register only when
the customer answered and an operator confirmed the answer** (D14,
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §1). This command exists to make that
happen, not to restate it.

Usage: `/brd-reconcile <BRD-KEY> @<review-file> [--sent <path>…]`

`<BRD-KEY>` still resolves through `resolve-address`, which searches every level
`workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds — three below `specifications/` — and so returns a BRD that owns
its source document, one of its slices, an idea-route PRD folder or an Epic folder alike, because a
root must be resolved before Phase 0 step 5a can refuse it by name. **Only a slice is
reconciled: a root BRD is refused, and reconciling happens at the slice and nowhere else** — a slice
holds its own register, its own `[C]` question set and its own ledger, and it is reconciled from
those and no others. Two things follow from inheritance and are named where they arise: its
**requirement** defect resolutions land in its **parent's** `brd/brd-defect-log.md`
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2.1), and the stale cross-reference sweep's root
is the **parent's** folder, so a sibling slice still asserting a superseded position is reached.

**Standing rule, binding on every phase below.** Nothing this command reads out of a returned review
becomes a `[CD#n]` on its own. Schema mode parses; free-text mode infers; **both hand the result to
an operator before a single register record is written**, and the operator sees the customer's own
words beside every row they are asked to confirm. The section *How no inferred decision becomes a
`[CD#n]`* below states the ordering that makes this structural rather than aspirational.

**This command takes no `--no-docs`, and it does no documentation grounding at all. That is a
decision, not an omission.** `/brd-intake` and `/prd-ground` already ground this BRD against the
shipped product documentation when `$DOCS_PATH` resolves (D22,
`workflows-core:docs-grounding`), and `/brd-interview` and `/brd-package`
deliberately do none for the same reason this command does none: it works on **decisions already
taken** — here, on decisions taken by the customer. This command goes one step further than either.
A documentation page is a claim *about* behaviour written by the delivery organisation, and the
whole content of this run is what the **customer** said; consulting a page here could only produce a
sentence that contradicts the one party whose authority this command is recording, and then quietly
lose the argument to it. So there is no flag to turn off, no `resolve-docs-grounding` call, and no
`docs grounding:` line in this command's report. The sentence is written here because leaving it
unwritten is exactly how the gap it forecloses gets shipped.

**No repository is opened, at any point.** Every finding this run reads was pinned, written and
independently re-derived by `/prd-ground`, so there is no baseline gate here, no dirty-tree stop, and
no `$REPOS_PATH` requirement. That has one consequence this command states rather than works around:
a customer challenge in the review's section 5 or 6, and a `will-change` finding whose named
prerequisite decision this run has just frozen, are both **named as needing a grounding pass** and
are never re-adjudicated here. A finding is not evidence until independently re-derived by a
different agent (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §8), and this command
re-derives nothing — a finding it wrote would be an unverified opinion wearing a `[CG#n]`.

---

## How no inferred decision becomes a `[CD#n]`

Five properties, and every one of them is a property of the **order and the inputs of the phases
below**, not an instruction to be careful. Together they are the guarantee; individually none of
them is.

1. **One agent reads the review, and it cannot mint.** `customer-review-reader` returns every
   free-text decision as a `candidate` carrying `confirmed: false`, and its hard rules forbid it
   minting any identifier in the delivery side's namespaces at all. So there is no route by which a
   `[CD#n]` arrives from the dispatch — the *Freeze the customer decisions* phase is the only writer
   of that prefix in this plugin, and it reads only what the phase before it confirmed.
2. **This command never widens the reader's mode.** It passes `auto`, or `free-text` where the
   operator has told it the file is prose, and it **never passes `schema`**. That agent fails closed
   to free text on a partial match by its own rule, and a caller that forced a parse would convert
   exactly the material the rule was protecting. There is also no re-dispatch to get a different
   answer: one dispatch, and the mode it reports is the mode the run works in.
3. **Confirmation runs to completion, over the whole candidate set, before the freeze phase opens.**
   The *Freeze the customer decisions* phase reads the confirmed set and nothing else, and no phase
   after it may add to that set. A candidate that never reached the operator is not a decision that
   was skipped; it is a run that stopped, and the *Confirm every candidate* phase's gate says so.
4. **Every candidate is put one at a time, with its verbatim quotation, and there is no bulk
   confirmation.** The picker carries no "confirm the rest" entry, and that omission is required
   rather than merely permitted: batching is what turns a confirmation into a formality, and the
   quotation is the entire mechanism — it is what lets a human check the agent's reading in one
   glance against the customer's own sentence.
5. **A reason nobody gave is never supplied.** `argumentation` is mandatory
   (`decision-register-format.md` §2) and on a `[CD#n]` it is the **customer's** reason. A candidate
   returned with `reason: not stated` cannot be frozen as `decided` by anybody in this run, and the
   two resolutions the *Confirm every candidate* phase offers both leave the reason where it belongs
   — with the customer.

The failure all five exist to prevent is stated once, in `agents/customer-review-reader.md`, and is
not restated here: **normalising prose into a register row *is* inference**, a `[CD#n]` reads
downstream as frozen customer authority, and nothing on the page would record that a sentence of
prose was read into it. Of everything this workflow does, that is the single way it could fabricate
the customer's own voice.

## The cross-BRD write guard

**Four phases below write outside the BRD folder this run was given, and all four take the same
guard.** They are:

| Phase | What it writes, and where |
|---|---|
| *Apply the required corrections* | an `applied` correction to an image's transcription in the **parent's** `brd/brd-figures.md`, when this run stands on a slice |
| *Resolve the defects the review settled* | `customer-amended <SLICE-KEY> <date>`, `withdrawn` and `resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]` rows into the **parent's** `brd/brd-defect-log.md`, when this run stands on a slice |
| *The propagation sweep* | sweep dispositions into a **dependent BRD's** `decisions.md` |
| *The stale cross-reference sweep* | `updated` corrections into any artifact under the parent, including a **sibling slice's** |

**The rule, once, for all four.** Before writing into an artifact that belongs to a BRD other than
the one this run was given, execute `require-on-main` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff require-on-main")`, §3) against that artifact. Any **stopping** row → **record, never write**: the intended change, the
artifact, and the concrete branch/PR state the gate reported all go into the reconciliation record
and the final report, and the file is left exactly as it was. Row F (`absent` — the artifact is on no
ref at all) is treated the same way and for the same reason: an artifact nobody has handed off is an
artifact somebody is still working on. `pass`, `pass_amending` and `unmanaged` → write.

**None of this ever stops the run.** The reconciliation is the *prerequisite's* customer loop, and
letting a dependent's open pull request block it would let any downstream BRD stall the BRD its own
positions rest on — the D20 failure, arriving from the other direction.

**Why the guard is one rule and not one per path.** Writing over a register, a defect log or a value
document that is sitting on somebody else's branch silently overwrites an in-flight run, and the
person whose work is lost finds out at their next `git status`, not here. That failure does not care
which of the paths reached it, so neither does the guard: a rule written once for the propagation
sweep alone would have left the other paths open, which is exactly how the second and third came to
exist.

**What is *not* covered, deliberately:** every artifact inside the BRD folder this run was given.
Those are gated once, in the *Resolve inputs and gate the sent package* phase, and re-gating each
write would re-ask a question already answered.

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve inputs and gate the sent package

1. **`<BRD-KEY>` (mandatory).** Parse the first token that is neither a flag nor a flag's value — `--sent` consumes the token after it (step 2), and a value skipped as "non-flag" would be read as the key; validate with `key-valid`
   (`workflows-core:addressing` §1). If absent or invalid, stop:
   `BRD_RECONCILE_NEEDS_KEY: /brd-reconcile needs a BRD key (shape ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*(-\d+)+$) and a returned review — re-run '/product-workflows:brd-reconcile <KEY> @<review-file>'.`
2. **`@<review-file>` (mandatory).** The file the customer sent back, **at whatever path it arrived
   on** — a downloads directory, a mail attachment saved anywhere, a shared drive. It is not
   required to be inside `$SPECS_PATH`, and it is never searched for: the operator says which file
   is the review, because a file this command picked is a file nobody submitted as the customer's
   answer. Absent, or not a readable file → stop:
   `BRD_RECONCILE_NEEDS_REVIEW: /brd-reconcile needs the returned review file — re-run '/product-workflows:brd-reconcile <KEY> @<review-file>' with the path the customer's file actually sits at.`

   **`--sent <path>` (optional, repeatable), each consuming the next token.** The material the
   customer was *actually sent* — the other half of the pair this command reconciles. It is for a
   review that answers a package this plugin did not build: one authored by hand before the route
   existed, or sent out of band. Each path may be a file or a directory and, like the review, may
   sit anywhere. Every path must resolve to something readable, or stop before the flag is allowed
   to replace anything:
   `BRD_RECONCILE_SENT_NOT_READABLE: --sent <path> is not a readable file or directory — re-run '/product-workflows:brd-reconcile <KEY> @<review-file> --sent <path>' with the path the sent material actually sits at.`
   The flag replaces step 6's package gate and **nothing else**: every other input step 8 reads is
   still read, wherever it is on file. It admits a hand-authored **package** —
   `/brd-intake --sort-existing` is the same accommodation made at the other end of the route, and
   this is its counterpart at this one — and **a slice never interviewed** as well. Such a slice
   holds no `interview/` record, and no `decisions.md` unless `/product-workflows:create-prd`
   recorded a roundless `[AS#n]` there (`decision-register-format.md` §7): the *Freeze the customer
   decisions* phase creates the register where none is on file, and with no `[C]` question and no
   `[SR#n]` on file a candidate there can answer only such an `[AS#n]` — any other comes back
   `unmatched` and goes to a human rather than being frozen (*Confirm every candidate*).
3. **`$SPECS_PATH` (required).** If unset, stop naming `SPECS_PATH`, per the
   `Required path environment variable unset` rule in
   `workflows-core:escalation-rules`:
   ```
   choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]
   ```
4. **Specs-repo preflight.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git specs-preflight")` and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline, **before** the gate below — `require-on-main`
   performs no fetch of its own (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.2) and relies on this step's best-effort one,
   the same ordering `/brd-package` uses and for the same reason. Prompt-free and silent when the
   specs repo is clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5 notice; if it returns
   `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag for the whole run.
5. **Resolve the BRD folder.** `resolve-address <BRD-KEY>` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3), which searches
   every level `workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds — three below `specifications/`, plus §5's legacy fallback — and so can return any folder kind it finds there: a `BRD-` folder directly under `specifications/`, a `PRD-` folder (a slice inside a BRD, or an idea-route PRD folder), or an `EPIC-` folder inside a `PRD-` folder. Step 5a answers the level question on what it returns. Absent
   → stop, without asserting which command would have created it:
   `BRD_RECONCILE_NOT_FOUND: no folder found for <BRD-KEY> under $SPECS_PATH/specifications/ (every level addressing.md §3 bounds, plus §5's legacy fallback) — check the key. A BRD with a source document of its own is created by /product-workflows:brd-intake <BRD-KEY> @<brd-file>; a slice is created by /product-workflows:brd-split on its parent.`
5a. **The root and Epic refusals — reconciling happens at the slice and nowhere else.** Take this the moment
    step 5 returns a resolved folder, before step 6 opens anything — the level question is answered
    before any gate that follows it. Test the **resolved directory's prefix**: `BRD-` is a root,
    `EPIC-` an Epic folder, `PRD-` a slice or an idea-route PRD folder, which step 5b tells apart — the kind-prefix convention `workflows-core:addressing` §2 fixes, read off
    the resolved folder's own name. **Never test the folder's asserted `kind:`** — `/brd-split`
    writes `kind: brd` into the `brd-link.md` it places inside the `PRD-` slice folder it carves
    (`commands/brd-split.md` Phase 3), so a slice **asserts** `brd` while being exactly the folder
    this refusal must accept; a gate on the asserted kind would refuse every slice and accept
    nothing.

    **Where the folder resolved through `workflows-core:addressing` §5's legacy unprefixed fallback,
    there is no prefix to test.** Answer the root question by **positive evidence, never by the
    absence of a file** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1, the
    shared authority every consumer of this test in this plugin takes it from, directly or through
    `workflows-core:addressing` §4.1, and not restated here — and the Epic question the same way, as
    §4.1 places a folder with no prefix: a resolved `kind: epic` is an Epic folder, refused below
    exactly as an `EPIC-` folder is.

    **An `EPIC-` folder is refused on the same prefix test, and at the same moment.**
    `resolve-address` searches every level `workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds, the Epic level
    included, so an Epic's key resolves here exactly as a slice's does — and without this refusal an
    `EPIC-` folder, which is neither `BRD-` nor `PRD-`, passed both this step and step 5b and reached
    step 6 on a folder that holds no package, coverage ledger or inventory of its own, whose row-F branch then named a remedy for a BRD it
    is not — and a `--sent` run, which replaces that gate, went on past it toward inputs with nothing to reconcile into. A prefix is the name beginning `EPIC-<the resolved key>-`, as §4.1 defines one, so a
    legacy folder whose key merely begins `EPIC-` is not refused by its name.

    On a root, look for the root-level artifacts this run would have produced under the retired
    two-level model — any `customer-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` or `reconciliation-<YYYYMMDD>.md` already
    in the folder — and name whichever exist in the stop, so an operator whose BRD was reconciled
    under that model is told the level moved rather than that their key is wrong. Never delete
    them; they record work done, and nothing in this run reads them.

    Stop:
    `BRD_RECONCILE_ROOT_LEVEL: <BRD-KEY> is a root BRD, and reconciling happens at the slice. Carve one with '/product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY> "<how to cut it>"', then run '/product-workflows:brd-reconcile <SLICE-KEY> @<review-file>'.<where root-level artifacts exist, append:> This BRD carries root-level reconciliation artifacts at <paths> from the earlier two-level model; it is left in place, and this command never reconciles against it.`

    Stop, on an Epic folder:
    `BRD_RECONCILE_EPIC_LEVEL: <KEY> resolves to an Epic folder at <path>, and reconciling happens at a slice carved from a customer's BRD — an Epic is refined from the PRD folder above it and holds no package, coverage ledger or inventory of its own. No gate was run and nothing was written. <remedy> Re-running this command on this Epic stops here again.`
    `<remedy>` turns on the folder containing this one: where it carries a `brd-link.md` naming a
    `parent:` — a slice — `Re-run this command against the slice this Epic sits in — '/product-workflows:brd-reconcile <SLICE-KEY>' with the rest of this invocation unchanged.`, `<SLICE-KEY>` being that `brd-link.md`'s own `key`, read and
    never parsed out of either folder's name; anywhere else, `The folder above it is not a slice carved from a customer's BRD, so there is no package, ledger or inventory for this command to reconcile into here, and --sent does not change that.` — naming no command, since step 5b refuses an idea-route PRD folder too. It is an argument halt, so `emit-block` does not fire.
5b. **The idea-route refusal — a `PRD-` folder is a slice only where a BRD carved it.** Step 5a's
    prefix test accepts every `PRD-` folder, and an idea-route PRD folder — `/product-workflows:create-prd`'s
    own output, never carved from a BRD — is one. Take this immediately after 5a, before step 6 opens anything — **`--sent` included**:
    the flag replaces step 6's package gate and nothing else, so without this step a `--sent` run
    would reach step 8 on a folder with no ledger and no inventory to reconcile into.
    Decide it by **positive evidence, exactly as `/product-workflows:prd-ground` Phase 0 step 5a
    sets `route: idea`**, and never by the absence of a ledger or inventory alone:
    - **A `PRD-` directory carrying no `brd-link.md`** — `/brd-split` is the only writer of a
      `brd-link.md` naming a `parent:` inside a `PRD-` folder, so this one was never carved from a
      BRD.
    - **A folder resolved through `workflows-core:addressing` §5's legacy unprefixed fallback,
      carrying no `brd-link.md`, neither `coverage-ledger.md` nor `brd/brd-inventory.md`, and a
      `prd.md` asserting `kind: prd`** — a legacy idea-route PRD folder
      (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1). The same shape without
      such a `prd.md` is not decided here, and step 6 handles it as it always has.

    Stop:
    `BRD_RECONCILE_NOT_A_SLICE: <KEY> resolves to an idea-route PRD folder (<path> carries no brd-link.md), not a slice carved from a customer's BRD — no gate was run and nothing was written. Reconciling applies a customer's returned review of a BRD slice's package, and this folder was never packaged by this route and holds no coverage ledger and no requirement inventory for a correction to land in; --sent does not change that. Check the key names the slice whose package the customer answered. The idea route goes on from its PRD: run '/product-workflows:create-ard <KEY>' or '/product-workflows:specify <KEY>' (after '/product-workflows:create-prd <KEY>' where the folder holds no prd.md yet). Where it holds a prd.md, run '/product-workflows:update-prd <KEY>' to revise that PRD from what the review says. Re-running this command on this folder stops here again.`
6. **Gate the sent package on main — unless `--sent` supplied one.**

   **What this gate is actually for, and why `--sent` can satisfy it.** The *Why the gate is the
   prompt and not the register* note below states the reason: a returned review quotes sentences,
   and a quotation is only checkable against a committed copy of the document it came from, at the
   version the customer received. That reason is about **a committed copy existing**, not about
   which command produced it. A review of a hand-authored package fails this gate, and without
   `--sent` no route could reconcile it — the operator cannot conjure a `/brd-package` run for a
   package sent before the route existed, and re-running `/brd-package` now would build a
   *different* document from the one the customer answered. `--sent` closes that by supplying the
   copy from the other direction: the operator names what was sent, and the *Canonicalise the
   returned review* phase commits it into the folder beside the review, in the same handoff, before
   anything reads either. The invariant is kept; only its provenance changes.

   **Where `--sent` was given, this gate is replaced by three checks and the phases below are
   unchanged:**
   - Step 2 already proved every `--sent` path readable.
   - **A plugin-built package must not also be on main.** **Where the resolved folder holds no
     `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md` at all, there is no path to gate on and the gate is not
     run**: the test is answered without it — nothing was handed off, so `--sent` is not redundant —
     and that is recorded with the admission below. This is the ordinary state on the path `--sent`
     exists for, and it is stated because the gate takes a concrete `path` input (§3) that a folder
     holding no prompt cannot supply; a run that formed one anyway would be gating on a filename it
     invented. Where the folder does hold one, run the ordinary gate below against the most recent,
     and where it would have passed, stop rather than admitting a second answer to "what did the
     customer see":
     `BRD_RECONCILE_SENT_REDUNDANT: <BRD-KEY> already has a handed-off customer package (customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md on <default-ref>) — drop --sent and re-run '/product-workflows:brd-reconcile <KEY> @<review-file>', which reconciles against the package that was built.`
     **"Would have passed" means §3.7 returned `pass` or `pass_amending`, and nothing else.** Those
     two are the states in which a package genuinely reached the default branch, which is what makes
     `--sent` redundant. `unmanaged` does **not** count: it is the hand-committed path this step's own
     sibling-verification paragraph singles out as the one whose implication does not hold, so a
     prompt found there proves less than the flag supplies and the two are not interchangeable —
     proceed with `--sent`, and record both facts. Where the ordinary gate would have stopped —
     either row-F state, or any stopping row of §3.7 — `--sent` proceeds instead of stopping. That is
     the whole of what it overrides.
   - **The admission is recorded, never silent.** Carry it into the *Write the reconciliation
     record* phase and the final report: this run reconciled against operator-supplied sent
     material, named path by path, not against a package this plugin built and handed off. A reader
     of the record must be able to tell the two apart, because only one of them was assembled under
     `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md`'s rules.

   **The ordinary gate, where `--sent` was not given.** This command **consumes** `$SPECS_PATH` deliverables it did not
   write, so per `workflows-core:phase-handoff` §5 rule 2 it executes
   `require-on-main` (§3) here, before anything else reads a file. Execute it against the resolved
   folder's **most recent `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md`** — the artifact whose presence
   proves a package was actually built and handed off. Every deliverable one `handoff-to-main` run
   stages lands in a single commit (§2.3), so on that path its presence on `origin/<default>` implies
   `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md`, `customer-delivery-note-<YYYYMMDD>.md` and the whole
   `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/` merged with it — the artifacts `/brd-package`'s handoff stages together —
   and `/brd-package`'s own gate on `decisions.md` had already run before any of them existed.

   **That implication holds for the `handoff-to-main` path and for no other**, which matters because
   this command's own second stop below sends an operator down a hand-committed one: files landed by
   hand can land in any grouping, or partially. So once the gate passes, **verify the siblings rather
   than inferring them** — check that `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` and `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/` of the same
   date are present, and report by name any that are not. A missing sibling never stops the run — the
   customer's answer is still their answer — but it is carried into the reconciliation record and the
   final report as a limit on what this run could check the review against, because a returned
   quotation with no committed bundle behind it cannot be matched to the document it came from
   (D13, D18). Inferring the siblings from one file's presence is exactly the assumption the
   hand-committed path breaks. Map
   the §3.7 return by `stopped` first: any stopping row → stop, naming the concrete branch/PR state
   it reports; `pass` → proceed; `pass_amending` → proceed, printing the §3.3 row-B message;
   `unmanaged` → proceed as before this feature; `absent` (row F) → **split it before stopping**, on
   a test row F cannot make. Row F means the prompt is on no ref at all, which covers two different
   states, and sending the wrong message for the second one walks the operator into a wall:

   - **No `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md` in the folder at all** — no package was ever built.
     `BRD_RECONCILE_NEEDS_PACKAGE: no customer package on file for <BRD-KEY> — run /product-workflows:brd-package <BRD-KEY> first, and reconcile the review that comes back from it. If this review answers a package sent before the route existed, re-run with --sent <path> naming what the customer was actually sent.`
   - **A prompt is in the folder, and on no ref** — the package was built and its handoff was
     declined. **Do not send the operator back to `/brd-package`**: that command refuses to rewrite a
     dated bundle, so re-running it today stops outright and re-running it on another date builds a
     *different* package from the one the customer was actually sent. What is needed is the package
     already on disk, landed:
     `BRD_RECONCILE_PACKAGE_NOT_HANDED_OFF: <BRD-KEY>'s package is written at <path> but is on no branch — its handoff was declined. Commit and merge the package's files to the specs repo's default branch, then re-run; do not re-run /product-workflows:brd-package, which will not rewrite a dated bundle.`
     This is the state `--sent` is **not** for: the package exists and is the right one, so landing it is the fix. Admitting a copy of it under `--sent` would put the same document in the folder twice under two names.

   **Why the gate is the prompt and not the register.** The committed package is what makes a
   returned review checkable at all: when the review quotes a sentence, there has to be a committed
   copy of the document that sentence came from, at the version the customer actually received (D18,
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §5). Reconciling against a package that
   exists only in somebody's working tree would freeze customer authority against a document nobody
   can produce later.
7. **Do not re-gate allocation, and do not re-gate the rounds.** Read `coverage-ledger.md` for the
   rows this run may move and for the final report's ledger line, but do not gate on it:
   `/brd-interview` already refused to run against an unallocated ledger, `/brd-package` refused to
   build against an unsettled round, and neither the register nor the package could be on main
   without both gates having passed. A `--sent` run cannot lean on either — its package was not built
   here, and its slice may never have been interviewed — and is not gated here either: a row it
   finds still `unallocated` is never refused, and the *Next steps* phase names
   `/product-workflows:brd-split` for it in place of `/product-workflows:create-prd`. Re-gating here
   would add a second, differently-worded copy of rules
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §6.1 and
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/interview-tagging.md` §5 already own, and the copies would
   eventually disagree. Where the ledger is read at all, the **dispositions in the file** are read
   and never the ledger line, for the reason that section gives.
8. **Read the inputs the rest of the run works from**, from the resolved folder — **"the gated
   folder" on the ordinary path; on a `--sent` run the folder was never gated, and step 6 says what
   stood in for that**: `decisions.md` (every `[VD#n]` and `[AS#n]` with its `status`, `evidence`,
   `defects`, `argumentation`, `conditional_on`, `altitude` and `round`), where it is on file — a
   `--sent` run can find none (step 2); `code-defect-log.md`, **when it exists** — every
   `[CDF#n]` with its `disposition`, `statement`, `intent` and `blocked_on`, so a record's `defects`
   list and a review row naming an entry both resolve to something rather than to a bare id; the file
   is absent on a BRD whose rounds raised no code defect, and that absence is an ordinary state and
   never a gate; `interview/customer-questions.md` and every `interview/round-<N>.md`, where on
   file — a slice never interviewed holds neither (step 2) — so each `[C]` is addressed by the
   round and position that identify it
   (`interview-tagging.md` §5 — a question mints no identifier of its own); every
   `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` on file — the one of the package this review answers is resolved in
   the *Ingest the review* phase, before the reader is dispatched — for the `[SR#n]` ids an
   `escalated-to-customer` disposition put in
   front of the customer; `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md` and the manifest of
   `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/`, so a review's document reference resolves to what was actually sent —
   **or, on a `--sent` run, the files under `customer-sent-<YYYYMMDD>/` in their place**, read here by
   name exactly as the bundle manifest is. They are what was actually sent on that path, and
   resolving a returned quotation against them is the entire reason the flag commits them; without
   this substitution the material would be committed and then handed to nothing. **A `--sent` run has
   no `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` and no `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md`**, so it resolves no
   `[SR#n]` and matches no prompt: record both absences as limits on what this run could check the
   review against — the same treatment a missing sibling gets on the ordinary path — and stop on
   neither;
   `brd/brd-inventory.md`'s `[BR#n]` rows; `coverage-ledger.md`; `brd-link.md`; every verified
   `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` with its `horizon`; and, when this is not the first reconciliation, every
   earlier `reconciliation-<YYYYMMDD>.md` and every earlier canonicalised review. Every one of those
   is an input, never scratch: nothing below deletes, renames or rewrites a dated artifact another
   run wrote. **The register, the log and the question set are read through
   `decision-register-format.md` §8, in this BRD's folder and in every folder the propagation sweep
   reaches**: a **torn write** — an item a `/brd-interview` run left when it stopped before writing
   the round record that would name it — counts for nothing. A torn entry or a torn `[AS#n]` matches
   no answer, so an answer the customer gave against it — whatever `customer-review-reader`, which
   reads the files it is handed as they stand, matched it to — is carried `unmatched`, as an answer
   to no question is, and never frozen; a torn record is read as absent, so it is neither superseded,
   nor reopened, nor swept; and a torn `[CDF#n]` resolves no `defects` id. This command removes none
   of them: removing a torn write is `/product-workflows:brd-interview`'s alone (§8), and the final
   report names each one found, with that command as the step that removes it.
9. **Fix the run's date.** One `<YYYYMMDD>` stamp, taken once, used for the reconciliation record
   this run writes and for the `Status:` line of any round it closes. It is **not** the stamp on the
   canonicalised review, which carries the customer's date — the *Canonicalise the returned review*
   phase says why.

---

## Phase 1 — Classify + model routing

Invoke the `model-routing` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "workflows-core:model-routing"`), then record:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: SIGNIFICANT     # floors here — this run freezes customer authority into the
                                  # register and writes dispositions into other BRDs' registers
  reason: <one-line>
  current_model: <the model this orchestrator is running under>
  detection_model: <§2.1 Sonnet chain: claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6/4-5>   # customer-review-reader, impl-maintenance
  opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
  notes: <any §2/§2.1 fallback or degradation>
```

**The classification floors at `SIGNIFICANT`** because of what this run changes rather than how much
of it there is: a `[CD#n]` is the only record in this workflow that carries authority the delivery
organisation cannot re-take on its own, and the propagation sweep writes into registers belonging to
BRDs this run was not pointed at. If no Opus resolves for `current_model`, degrade to best-available,
record it in `notes` and in the final report, and never hard-block.

`customer-review-reader` runs at `detection_model` and carries no frontmatter pin, and that is safe
for a reason worth stating rather than assuming: **nothing that agent returns is authority.** Every
free-text decision comes back an unconfirmed candidate and every schema row is confirmed against the
file before it is frozen, so a weaker model's worst outcome is a decision it *missed* — which
surfaces as an unanswered `[C]` that stays open and gets re-asked — and never a decision it
*invented*, which the confirmation phase would have to catch. The recoverable failure is the one the
routing is allowed to risk.

---

## Phase 2 — Canonicalise the returned review, and commit it before anything reads it

**The order is the point.** The review is copied into the BRD folder under a canonical name and
handed off **before a single phase below reads it**, because a run that dies halfway through an
ingest must not be the reason the customer's own document cannot be found again. It arrived on a
path nobody else can reproduce; the copy is the record.

1. **Derive the review's date**, in this order, and stop at the first that answers:

   1. **The review date stated in the review's own section 1** (*Review identity and evidence
      limitations* — who reviewed, in what role, **on what date**). This is the customer asserting
      their own date in their own document, which is exactly what is wanted.
   2. **A `<YYYYMMDD>` in the supplied filename** — the schema asks the reviewer to name the file
      for the date they finished, so a file that came back unrenamed carries it. **Reject this rung
      where that date matches the date on *any* `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md` in this
      folder**, and fall through to rung 3 — *any*, not only the most recent one this run gated on,
      because a review may legitimately answer an earlier package and would then echo that package's
      stamp rather than the latest: the two matching is the signature of a reviewer echoing the
      package's own stamp rather than dating their work, and a filename that merely repeats the
      packaging date settles nothing. It is not proof — a review genuinely finished the day the
      package was built produces the same collision — which is why the fallback is a prompt that
      shows the operator both dates rather than a silent choice either way.
   3. **Otherwise prompt the operator for it**, in plain text, naming what it is for and showing the
      packaging date beside it so they can see what was rejected and why.

   **The date is the customer's, not this run's, and not the package's either.** Naming the copy by
   today's date would record when the delivery team got round to ingesting the review; naming it by
   the packaging date would record when the delivery team *sent* it. Neither is when the review was
   written, and every claim in it is dated against the package it answers. Ordering section 1 ahead
   of the filename is what makes that true rather than aspirational: a filename is chosen by whoever
   saved the file and can be an artifact of the send, while section 1 is a statement the reviewer
   made inside the review.
2. **Resolve the canonical name**, which is the date plus, where the date alone is taken, a
   disambiguating suffix:

   ```
   <BRD-dir>/customer-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md              # the ordinary case
   <BRD-dir>/customer-review-<YYYYMMDD>-<suffix>.md     # a second review carrying the same date
   ```

   The base name follows the BRD folder's own convention — the same `<artifact>-<YYYYMMDD>.md` shape
   as the prompt, the delivery note and the self-review it sits beside — rather than the spaced
   filename the customer was asked to send, which was chosen to be legible in a mail client and is
   not how this folder addresses anything.

   Resolve it as follows, and **never overwrite a differing file**:

   - **Nothing at the base name** → use the base name.
   - **The base name exists and is byte-identical to the source** → this is a resumed run. Use it,
     and say so.
   - **The base name exists and differs** → this is a **second review carrying the same date**, and
     it is an ordinary state, not an error: a customer sends a corrected resend the same afternoon,
     or two reviewers on their side each return a file. **Prompt for a disambiguating suffix** — the
     same plain-text prompt step 1 already owns, asking for a short lowercase slug of
     `[a-z0-9-]`, 1–24 characters, naming what tells this review apart (`corrected`, `second-reviewer`).
     Then resolve the suffixed name by these same three tests, re-prompting where the suffixed name
     is itself taken by something different, naming what is already there so the operator can pick a
     suffix that is free.

   **A date cannot be the disambiguator, which is why a suffix exists.** Where both files were
   genuinely written on the same day, step 1 derives the same date from either, and there is nothing
   truthful to change it to — telling the operator to rename the incoming file would be telling them
   to record a date the review does not carry, and refusing to ingest it would make the second review
   permanently unreadable by this command. The suffix is what lets the folder hold two reviews of one
   date without either of them lying about when it was written. The *Write the reconciliation record*
   phase already anticipates the same state from the other end — two reviews ingested on one day are
   two events, and that record appends rather than overwriting — and this is the affordance that
   makes reaching it possible.

   **A returned review is never overwritten**, whatever the name resolves to. It is the customer's
   document and the counterpart of the immutable source `/brd-intake` copies in (D11): two different
   reviews under one name leaves nobody able to say which one a `[CD#n]` was frozen from. The
   byte-identical case is admitted deliberately, and it is what keeps a run that failed after the copy
   from being unresumable.

   Only one thing here stops the run, and it is the operator declining to name a suffix at all:
   `BRD_RECONCILE_REVIEW_EXISTS: <BRD-dir>/customer-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md already exists and differs from the file supplied, and no disambiguating suffix was given — a returned review is never overwritten. Re-run and supply a suffix, or reconcile the review already on file.`
3. **Copy the source to the resolved canonical name**, byte for byte. Everything below reads that
   copy, cites that copy, and names that copy — including the suffix, where one was taken.

   **Which review a `[CD#n]` was frozen from is recorded in the reconciliation record, not on the
   record itself.** `decision-register-format.md` §1 fixes thirteen fields and none of them names a
   source document, so `decisions.md` read alone cannot distinguish an answer frozen from a
   corrected resend from one frozen from the file it replaced. What distinguishes them is the
   *Write the reconciliation record* phase: each pass sits under its own heading naming the review
   file that caused it, and lists the `[CD#n]` ids that pass froze. Say that plainly rather than
   claiming the register carries it — the *Confirm every candidate* phase's same-review skip keys on
   "an earlier pass over **this same review**", and the only place that mapping exists is the
   record this phase's canonical name feeds into.
4. **Copy the `--sent` material, where the flag was given** — **before** the handoff below, under the
   same ordering rule and into the same commit, because it is the other half of the pair and is admissible only as a committed
   copy (the *Resolve inputs and gate the sent package* phase says why). Ask the operator, in plain
   text, for the date this material was sent — nothing on disk asserts it, exactly as nothing
   asserted the review's date at step 1's third rung — then copy every `--sent` path **verbatim**
   into:

   ```
   <BRD-dir>/customer-sent-<YYYYMMDD>/
   ```

   preserving each path's own basename, and recursively for a directory. The folder is named
   `customer-sent-` and not `bundle-` deliberately: a `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/` is what
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` builds under its own rules, and a later
   `/brd-package` run reading this folder must not mistake hand-authored material for one of its
   own. Resolve collisions by the same three tests step 2 uses — free, byte-identical (a resumed
   run), or differing (prompt for a suffix) — and **never overwrite a differing file**: this is the
   customer's record as much as the review is.

   The sent date is the customer's send, not this run's and not the review's. It may legitimately
   equal or precede the review's date; it is not checked against it, because a send that predates
   the plugin has no record to check against and inventing one would be the failure this whole
   admission exists to avoid.

5. **Hand it off.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff")` and present its §4.3 choice array verbatim — the **advisory** array, which is the class §4.0 puts the returned review in: read (by this run's own reader dispatch, and by a later run's step-2 overwrite refusal) and gated by nothing, since §3.4's row for this command targets the *sent prompt* rather than the returned review. That is the same fact the *Declining does not stop the ingest* paragraph below states, and the **gated — stopping** array contradicted it in the operator's own prompt.
   ```
   choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git (no command stops on this; what reads it reads your working copy)", "Cancel"]
   ```
   On the first choice, execute `handoff-to-main` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff handoff-to-main")`, §2) with `prefix: brd` (§2.9's
   table, where `brd` is the prefix every `/brd-*` command shares), `feature_folder` as resolved in
   the *Resolve inputs and gate the sent package* phase, `deliverable_paths` = the canonicalised
   review at the name step 2 resolved, plus — where step 4 wrote any — **every file beneath
   `customer-sent-<YYYYMMDD>/`, one literal repo-relative path each, never the directory**. §2.3
   stages by enumeration and classifies anything it was not handed as OTHER, so a declaration naming
   the folder looks complete and ships nothing; `/brd-intake`'s handoff spells out the same trap.
   Step 4 held that list as it copied — pass it unchanged. Then
   `title: <BRD-KEY> Record the returned customer review <YYYYMMDD>`. Emit its
   §4.1 outcome line in the final report, labelled as the review's handoff so it is not confused with
   the run's own.

   **This is the first of two `handoff-to-main` calls in this run, and they are two different
   questions.** This one hands off **the customer's document**; the *Handoff* phase near the end
   hands off **what this run decided about it**. The second reuses the branch this one created —
   §2.2's rule 3 resolves an in-progress branch of the caller's own prefix by reusing it rather than
   colliding with it, and §3.3's row B names a branch "created earlier in the same invocation via
   this caller's own `handoff-to-main`" as an anticipated state.

   **Two calls emit two §4.1 outcome lines, and that is the contract rather than a divergence from
   it.** That section counts **per handoff the run offers**, not per run, and names this command as
   the only producer in the family that offers two — every other offers it **at most** once, so for
   them the two counts are the same number, zero included: a producer that offers no handoff at all
   (§4.1) executes none and prints none. It requires of a multi-handoff producer that
   **each line name which handoff it reports**, which is why neither is printed bare here: one
   reports the customer's document, the other this run's own deliverable, wherever either appears.
   **A `<merge-clause>` resolves from the second**, and by `workflows-core:next-phase-offer`'s own
   rule rather than by anything local: that file resolves the clause from the line reporting the
   handoff of **the artifact the offered command's gate targets**, which here is the reconciliation
   record with `decisions.md` and `coverage-ledger.md` beside it — what
   `/product-workflows:brd-package` and `/product-workflows:prd-ground` gate on — and not the
   canonicalised review this run also landed.

   **Declining does not stop the ingest.** Options 2 and 3 both decline the handoff (§4.3), the copy
   stays written, and the run proceeds — the copy-before-ingest ordering this phase exists for is
   satisfied by the copy, and what a decline costs is the push, which the run's own handoff offers
   again with this file still first in `deliverable_paths`. Refusing to ingest here would leave an
   operator holding a review this plugin will not process until they run git themselves, which is
   precisely the wrong place to put a wall in a workflow whose whole shape is a human in the loop.

**Everything below reads the canonicalised copy and never the supplied path.** The agent is given
the copy, the register cites the copy, and the reconciliation record names the copy. The original is
mentioned once, in the record, as where it came from. The same holds for the `--sent` material: what
is quoted against is the committed copy under `customer-sent-<YYYYMMDD>/`, never the path it was
supplied from.

---

## Phase 3 — Ingest the review

Dispatch `customer-review-reader` **once**, at `detection_model`:

→ Agent (subagent_type: "product-workflows:customer-review-reader", model: `<detection_model>`):
  > "brd_key:     [the BRD key]
  > review_path: [absolute path to the canonicalised copy, at the name the *Canonicalise the returned review* phase resolved — customer-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md, or the suffixed form where it took one]
  > package:
  >   questions:   [path to interview/customer-questions.md, when one is on file]
  >   assumptions: [path to decisions.md, when one is on file]
  >   self_review: [path to the self-review of the package this review answers, resolved below — omitted where it cannot be determined]
  > mode: auto"

**Resolve the self-review of the package this review answers, before the dispatch.** An `[SR#n]` is
scoped to one dated self-review, and every package numbers its findings from `[SR#1]` again
(`/product-workflows:brd-package`), so the same id names a different finding in each: the reader
may be handed only the file of the package the review answers, and never another. The known set
is the dated `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md` files in the folder, one per package built, and
the package is resolved against it, reading section 1 as this command reads it for the review's date
(the *Canonicalise the returned review* phase, step 1), in this order:

1. **The `Package reviewed: <BRD-KEY> <YYYYMMDD>` line** `/product-workflows:brd-package` prints
   into the prompt and the review's section 1 repeats (`customer-review-schema.md` §4), where
   section 1 carries it, its key is this BRD's, and its date names exactly one prompt on file.
2. **Otherwise a date section 1 names among the documents it lists as available** — the prompt's or
   the bundle's — where exactly one such date names exactly one prompt on file.
3. **Otherwise the only package on file**, where there is one.
4. **Otherwise ask the operator** — section 1 names no package, names a date that matches no prompt
   on file, or names dates that match two — with the dated prompts printed above the prompt, most
   recent first, and the date or dates section 1 named, if any, beside them. Two or three prompts
   on file: every one, then the decline —
   `choices: ["<BRD-KEY> package <YYYYMMDD-1>", "<BRD-KEY> package <YYYYMMDD-2>", "Cannot tell — leave it undetermined"]`,
   with a third package before the decline where there is one. Four or more: the three most recent
   and the overflow option, the full list staying in the prose above it as
   `workflows-core:epic-picker`'s *The cap* sets out —
   `choices: ["<BRD-KEY> package <YYYYMMDD-1>", "<BRD-KEY> package <YYYYMMDD-2>", "<BRD-KEY> package <YYYYMMDD-3>", "Another package from the list above — name its date"]`,
   where declining is a free-text answer. No option is marked `(Recommended)`: which package the
   customer answered is theirs to know, and the run has nothing to rank by. A free-text answer is
   resolved only against the dated prompts on file, never parsed into a date that names none; one
   that names no package on file, or declines, leaves the package undetermined.

**Where nothing determines it** — the operator could not tell — `self_review` is omitted, so every
`[SR#n]` answer in the review comes back `unmatched`, and each is listed under *what still needs a
human* as an answer to a finding of an undetermined package, never matched against another
package's file; the *Confirm every candidate* phase's re-point refuses an `[SR#n]` on this run for
the same reason. The reconciliation record names the file
resolved, or that none could be (*Write the reconciliation record*). A `--sent` run has no
self-review at all and supplies none (*Resolve inputs and gate the sent package*, step 8).

Supply the inputs **exactly as that agent's own Inputs contract declares them**. It refuses to run
without `review_path`, returning `status: INPUT_MISSING`, and returns `status: REVIEW_MISSING` when
the path does not resolve. Map either to a stop naming the field or the path it named — both are
defects in this dispatch rather than in the review, and proceeding past one would reconcile against
nothing:
`BRD_RECONCILE_READER_CONTRACT: customer-review-reader returned <status> — the dispatch, not the review, is at fault; the canonicalised copy is at <path>.`

**`mode: auto`, and never `mode: schema`.** That agent treats anything short of a positive,
in-order, twelve-section match with a row-shaped section 7 as free text, by its own fail-closed rule,
and a caller that overrode it to `schema` would be asking for the one conversion this whole command
is built to prevent. The only override this command may pass is `free-text`, and only where the
operator has said outright that the file is prose — a narrowing, never a widening. **There is no
second dispatch.** Re-dispatching a review that came back free-text, hoping for a parse, is the same
override taken slowly.

**Record what the digest says, before working it.** The mode and its `mode_evidence`; the
`package_reviewed` line the reader found, and, where it names a package other than the one resolved
above, that disagreement as an anomaly; the twelve
sections with each marked `present`, `stated-none` or `absent` — two facts that are never merged;
`evidence_limitations`, including a `stated: false` that says the review's evidentiary basis is
unknown; the decisions with their provenance; `unanswered_questions`; `challenges`;
`required_changes`; `anomalies`; and `notes`.

**Then test the digest for emptiness, because the three later gates cannot.** `BRD_RECONCILE_UNCONFIRMED`, `BRD_RECONCILE_UNDISPOSED_CORRECTION` and `BRD_RECONCILE_UNSWEPT` each count items still *undisposed*, so a digest carrying zero decisions, zero `required_changes` and zero challenges satisfies all three **vacuously**: the run freezes zero `[CD#n]`, sweeps nothing, writes a reconciliation record and reports success over a review nobody read anything out of. A count tests a property of the items that exist; what is wrong here is that none does.

The discriminator is **the verdict written in section 2** — read from that section's `content`, where the schema fixes it to `approved`, `approved-with-required-changes` or `not-approved`. The digest carries no top-level verdict field; section 2's `state` says whether the section is there at all. Three cases, exhaustive and non-overlapping, decided in this order:

1. **Any of the three sets is non-empty** → ordinary run. Nothing below applies.
2. **All three empty, and section 2's verdict reads `approved`** → the customer approved the package and asked for nothing. That is a real answer and an ordinary outcome: proceed, and record it as an approval in the reconciliation record. A review that changes nothing is a review, and refusing it would make "we accept it as it stands" unrecordable.
3. **All three empty, and anything else** — section 2 reading `approved-with-required-changes` or `not-approved`, or `state: absent`, or `state: stated-none`, or a value outside the three → stop. A `stated-none` section 2 is a review that declined to give a verdict at all. A verdict that says something is required, beside three empty sets, is the review contradicting itself or the parse failing; a section 2 that is absent, `stated-none`, or outside the three values is a review with no usable verdict. Neither is a customer who agreed:
   `BRD_RECONCILE_EMPTY_DIGEST: customer-review-reader returned no decisions, no required changes and no challenges, while section 2 reads <verdict | absent | stated-none>. An approval says so in section 2; this does not, so this is a read that failed or a review that contradicts itself. The canonicalised review is at <path>; open it, and re-run '/product-workflows:brd-reconcile <KEY> @<review-file>' — telling the run the file is prose, so the reader takes free-text mode, where the schema pass could not see it.`

**Why the verdict and not the section markers.** Two earlier attempts at this test failed on the same schema fact. The first asked whether every "substantive" section was `stated-none` — a word this file defines nowhere. The second asked whether **all twelve** were `stated-none`, which **can never be true**: sections 1, 2, 9 and 11 carry content by their own definitions in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/customer-review-schema.md` §4 — who reviewed and when, the verdict, ownership, the readiness sentence — so a customer who approves everything still returns four `present` sections, and every clean approval fell into the stop. Section 2's verdict is a closed vocabulary the schema guarantees, it is what the customer asserts rather than what they omit, and `approved` beside three empty sets is *coherent* where the other two verdicts beside three empty sets are not. Keying on a field that must exist is what makes the test decidable at all.

**Present every anomaly to the operator now, before any candidate is confirmed, and repair none.**
The agent reports departures from the schema rather than resolving them, and this command does the
same: a section missing rather than present and saying `none`, a section out of order, a verdict
outside the three values, a verdict its own later sections contradict, an identifier the review
appears to have minted. Each of those changes how section 7 should be read — a verdict of `approved`
sitting next to an unresolved blocker means the review is not saying what its verdict says — and an
operator who meets them after confirming twelve candidates has already confirmed them against the
wrong reading. Nothing here is a stop: an anomalous review is still the customer's answer, and the
anomalies travel into the reconciliation record and into the final report.

**Section 7 of a returned review carries three id shapes, and the matcher accepts all three —
which is why all three question sets are supplied above.** Passing only the first two would leave
the third unmatchable however plainly this command asserts the matcher accepts it: a contract the
agent is not given the input for is a rule with no consumer. The
review's decision log answers what the package's part *the decisions the customer must make* put to
it, and `/brd-package` fills that part from three sources:

| What the review's section 7 may cite | Where it came from | What it matches against |
|---|---|---|
| a `[C]` question, by its round and position | `interview/customer-questions.md` | the round record's entry for that question, whatever state it holds now — the package put it while it was *held for the customer*, and a corrected resend answers it again after an earlier review closed it *answered by the customer*, which *Confirm every candidate* disposes of |
| an `[AS#n]` | every open assumption in the register (`decision-register-format.md` §7) | the `[AS#n]` record itself, whatever its status — one an earlier review already settled resolves to its live record (*Confirm every candidate*) |
| an `[SR#n]` | a self-review finding disposed `escalated-to-customer` | that finding's record in `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` |

**The third is not an oversight to be narrowed away.** `/brd-package` puts an escalated self-review
finding to the customer under its own `[SR#n]` rather than minting a `[C]` for it, precisely because
minting one would put a question to the customer that never went through the tag test
(`interview-tagging.md` §2). A parser that accepted only the first two would silently drop every
answer to a finding the delivery team escalated on purpose, and the drop would look like customer
silence. A row citing none of the three is `unmatched` and is carried as such — a customer may
legitimately decide something nobody asked, and forcing it onto the nearest question loses both the
answer and the question — and it is never frozen, only recorded for a human or rejected (*Confirm
every candidate*).

## Phase 4 — Confirm every candidate (D14)

**No `[CD#n]` is written while any decision the digest returned is unconfirmed.** Present each one to
the operator, **one at a time, never batched**, with:

- the statement as it would be registered, and the answer;
- the **verbatim quotation** from the review it rests on — always, in both modes;
- what it appears to answer, in one of the three id shapes above, or `unmatched`;
- whether the answer is one of the options that question, assumption or finding put, or outside
  them, and the `chosen` it would be frozen with — the option it maps to, or the marked
  outside-the-options form — so that confirming the row confirms that mapping;
- where its target has a live record (below), that record — its id, status, `chosen` and quoted
  reason — and whether the row as shown would re-affirm it;
- the reason the customer gave, or `not stated` as the plain fact it is;
- in free-text mode, the agent's own `confidence`, and every `conflict` flag naming the other
  candidate this one pulls against.

```
choices: ["Confirm — this is what the customer decided; freeze it", "Correct it — the row does not match the quotation; supply the row that does, and freeze that", "Reject — not a customer decision at all, a declared refusal to answer included; record why", "Ask the customer — the answer is not clear enough to freeze; the question is left as it stands"]
```

**A customer who explicitly declines to answer takes *Reject*, and the schema guarantees that case
exists** (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/customer-review-schema.md` §5): the reader returns it as
what it is, and it is **not** a customer decision, so nothing about it may be frozen — *Confirm*
would write a non-answer into the register as the customer's own authority, which is the D14 failure
arriving through the one door left open. It is not *Ask the customer* either: that option is for an
answer too unclear to freeze, and a decline is perfectly clear. **What *Reject* records here is the
decline itself** — the customer's words, and their reason or `not stated` as the plain fact it is —
in this run's own reconciliation record and in the rejection's recorded reason. **The question's own
state does not move**: a held one keeps the *held for the customer* holding state `/brd-interview`
gave it, and a later round can put it again, drop it, or take it as a `[V]` the delivery team
settles; one an earlier review already answered stays *answered by the customer*, its record
untouched.
**Nothing writes "declined" anywhere**, and that is the point rather than an omission — it is in
neither vocabulary `/brd-interview` fixes (five terminal dispositions, four holding states, and
everything else a holding state and never a disposition), so a run that recorded it as a terminal
disposition would let the round's closure test see every question settled and **close a round on a
question the customer expressly refused to answer**, which is the D14 failure this disposition
exists to prevent, arriving quietly. *Reject* mints no `[C]`, writes nothing into the question
set, and closes no round.

**This is not an escalation choice list** — its four options are the four fates a candidate
answering a question the package put can take in this command (one answering none takes the two
below, and two confirmed onto one question are then put to the pick below), the same way `/brd-package`'s disposition picker draws its four from its reviewer agent's
contract and `/brd-interview`'s will-change picker draws its three from
`decision-register-format.md` §6. It carries **no bulk confirmation**, and that omission is required
rather than merely permitted: a "confirm the rest" entry would return the whole mechanism to the
state D14 exists to end, in one keystroke.

**The free-text option cannot be omitted, so it is bounded instead.** The harness supplies it on
every array (`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0), and on a picker about
customer authority that is exactly the box into which something which is neither the customer's
decision nor a refusal of it could be typed and then frozen as theirs — the route D14 closes. So a
free-text answer here is **normalised into one of the four dispositions, or the candidate is
re-asked**; it is never written through as a fifth value, and it never becomes a `[CD#n]` on its own
authority. If the operator's words do not land on one of the four, that is itself the signal to
choose *Ask the customer*.

**That requirement is enforceable only because the shared reference names this array.**
`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0 makes the free-text option unconditional —
no array can decline it — so a picker about customer authority is protected by what the run does with
the answer, not by the array's shape. Its *Closed-vocabulary pickers must normalise the free-text
answer* section therefore names this picker, the missing-reason picker and the conflicting-answer
picker below, and the propagation sweep's, and gives that reason. Until that section was rewritten the file said the opposite of what
this command needs: it called adding a trailing free-text entry "the one permitted adjustment", which
would have **authorised** an agent to open the exact hole D14 closes, on the authority of the file
this command is bound by. A rule contradicted by its own authority is not a rule, so it is stated in
both places or in neither.

**Aborting the walk stops the run with nothing frozen, and that is the honest description.** The
array lists the four dispositions and no `Cancel`: the harness always supplies a free-text option, so
an abort is reachable without spending one of the four slots
(`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0), and this paragraph is where its
consequence is stated instead. No `[CD#n]`
exists until the *Freeze the customer decisions* phase runs, so an aborted walk has written nothing
to the register and the confirmations taken in it are lost with the session. What survives is what
was on disk before: the canonicalised review, committed if its handoff was accepted. A re-run reads
it again and re-offers every candidate — which is exactly why the resume rule below keys on the
`[CD#n]` records **on file** rather than on anything this phase held in memory.

**Both modes go through this phase, and they are not the same act.** In schema mode the rows come
back `parsed` — provenance, not promotion — and what the operator is confirming is that the register
row about to be written says what the customer's own row says. In free-text mode the rows come back
`candidate`, and what the operator is confirming is **an agent's reading of prose**. The second is
where a mandate could be manufactured, so the free-text walk states, per candidate, that the row is
an inference and that the quotation beside it is the only thing the customer actually wrote.

**Rejecting and asking are real options and are meant to be used.** *Reject* is the answer for
context, scheduling, thanks and apology that an agent shaped like a decision — a candidate minted
from one is noise a human must now refute rather than confirm — **and it is the answer for the
customer's explicit refusal to answer** (above), which is not noise at all but is equally not a
decision. *Ask the customer* is the answer for
a conflict flag and for a low confidence the quotation does not carry. Both are recorded with their
reason; **nothing is silently dropped**, because a candidate that vanishes is indistinguishable from
one nobody looked at.

**An answer matching no question the package put is never frozen.** A candidate whose target is
`unmatched` — a decision the customer volunteered about something nobody asked them, a requirement
they withdrew with no question behind it among them — has no `[C]` question, `[AS#n]` or `[SR#n]`
to answer: nothing records what it was offered, what it settles or which round it closes, and a
`[CD#n]` built for it would be a decision the delivery side put to nobody. It is shown with the
same facts and put instead of the array above:

```
choices: ["Record it for a human — name the requirement it bears on and quote the customer (Recommended)", "Reject — not a customer decision at all, a declared refusal to answer included; record why"]
```

The first writes it into the reconciliation record's *what still needs a human*: the `[BR#n]` or
other identifier the customer's row names, where it names one — never one inferred from its prose —
and the customer's words verbatim, so the person who takes it up — in a later interview round, or
with the customer directly — has what the customer actually wrote.

**A reader can mis-match, and the typed answer is the route for that.** `unmatched` is the reader's
verdict, not the customer's, and a candidate that does answer a question the package put — the
reader missed the question's round and position, or the customer cited it loosely — would otherwise
have only these two options, neither of which freezes what the customer decided. So a typed answer
**naming the question the candidate answers** — a `[C]` question by its round and position, an
`[AS#n]` or an escalated `[SR#n]` of the self-review the *Ingest the review* phase resolved, and no
`[SR#n]` where it resolved none, resolved against the three sets the package put and never parsed
out of the customer's prose — **re-points the candidate onto that question**: it is shown again
with that target, on the four-option array above, and takes whichever of the four the operator then
chooses, exactly as a candidate the reader matched would. The re-point is recorded in the
reconciliation record — the candidate, the target the reader returned, and the question the
operator named — so a later reader can see that the match was the operator's and not the reader's. A
typed answer naming no question the package put, or naming none at all, is normalised into one of
the two options or the candidate is re-asked, as above; it never becomes a `[CD#n]` on this form.

**An answer outside the options put is a decision like any other, and *Confirm* is its route.**
Where the customer answered with none of the options the `[C]` question, the `[AS#n]` or the
escalated `[SR#n]` put — they chose neither reading, or dropped the requirement instead — the answer
is still theirs and still clear, so *Confirm* freezes it, and the *Freeze the customer decisions*
phase writes `chosen` in the one marked form `decision-register-format.md` §1 fixes for an answer
outside the options, with `options_considered` left exactly as it was put. It is not *Correct it*,
which is for a row that misreads its own quotation, and not *Ask the customer*, which is for an
answer that is unclear; an answer outside the options is neither.

**A candidate whose reason is `not stated` cannot be frozen as `decided`, by anyone in this run.**
`argumentation` is mandatory (`decision-register-format.md` §2) and on a `[CD#n]` it is the
customer's own reason for their own decision. Where *Confirm* is chosen on such a candidate — and it
does not re-affirm its question's live record, which takes it out of this picker's reach (below) —
exactly two resolutions follow:

```
choices: ["Ask the customer for the reason — nothing is frozen; a held [C] stays held for the customer and its round stays open", "Freeze the answer as [CD#n] with status: open, naming the absent reason — nothing downstream may consume it until the reason arrives", "Cancel"]
```

The second is not a workaround: `open` means raised and not yet settled, and a decision may not be
consumed downstream while it is open (`decision-register-format.md` §3), so the answer is on the
record and unusable until the customer supplies what makes it defensible. What this picker does not
offer is the operator writing the reason themselves. A supplied reason is the delivery team's
argument recorded as the customer's, and it will be defended later as theirs — the exact failure the
mandatory field exists to prevent, arriving through the one door the field cannot close.

**A re-run never re-asks what an earlier pass over the same review already settled.** Every earlier
`reconciliation-<YYYYMMDD>.md` was read in the *Resolve inputs and gate the sent package* phase, and
each pass in one sits under a heading naming the review file it reconciled and lists the `[CD#n]`
ids it froze, completed or re-decided in place (*Canonicalise the returned review*, step 3). A
candidate whose target's chain — below — holds a record an earlier pass over **this same review**,
the same canonicalised file with its suffix, froze, completed or re-decided in place is skipped and
reported as *already reconciled*, never re-offered, **whatever that record's status is now**. The
review's answer is on the record already, and where something has since moved the question — a later
review's answer superseding that record, or a propagation sweep withdrawing it — offering the
earlier review's answer again would revert that move: re-running an earlier review, which a
recorded-not-written dependent makes an ordinary step (*Write the reconciliation record*), never
supersedes a later review's answer. Where the live record is no longer that pass's record, the
report says which it is instead: *already reconciled, superseded since by* `[CD#m]`, or *already
reconciled, withdrawn since*. Without this rule a run cancelled halfway and restarted would mint a
second `[CD#n]` for one question, and **two customer answers to one question is a contradiction one
record has no way to hold** (`interview-tagging.md` §5, `decision-register-format.md` §1). **For an
`[SR#n]` target the rule needs no self-review file**: a pass
over the same review answered the same package, so an earlier pass over this same review that lists
a `[CD#n]` answering this `[SR#n]` is enough, and the chain is followed from that record — which
keeps the rule working on a reconciliation record written before passes named their self-review
file. The rule compares nothing — it keys on the review's name and the record's id — so it is taken
before the candidate is shown. A candidate whose target no pass over this review froze anything for
— every
candidate onto it was rejected or sent back to the customer — is offered again.

**Every target resolves to its question's live record before any candidate is shown.** Start from
the earliest record frozen against the target:

- **a `[C]` entry**: the `[CD#n]` its first *answered by the customer* names; or, where an answer to
  it was frozen `open` for want of its reason before any answer closed it — step 1 of the *Freeze
  the customer decisions* phase leaves such an entry held and writes nothing on it — that record,
  found where an earlier reconciliation record lists it, as *What changed* does every `[CD#n]`
  frozen, against the entry's round and position; or, on an entry holding neither, the record its `-
  **Re-puts:**` line names. An entry whose last recorded state is another terminal disposition,
  *split* or *re-tagged* (`/product-workflows:brd-interview`), is no longer a question anybody
  answers as it was put: its candidate is carried `unmatched`, and a typed answer can re-point it
  onto a question that stands (above);
- **an `[AS#n]`**: the assumption itself. It holds no `chosen` (`decision-register-format.md` §7),
  so while it is still `open` none of the re-affirmation tests below applies to it — an answer to an
  open assumption is always a new answer (step 2) — and neither kind of `open` those tests name is
  an assumption's;
- **an `[SR#n]`**: **never by its id alone**, because every package numbers its self-review findings
  from `[SR#1]` again (`/product-workflows:brd-package`), so the same id names a different finding
  in each. It resolves through the self-review file of the package this review answers, as the
  *Ingest the
  review* phase resolved it — an `[SR#n]` answer reaches this phase only where that file was
  determined, and is `unmatched` otherwise — to the `[CD#n]` an earlier pass's reconciliation
  record lists as answering that `[SR#n]` of that same file (*Write the reconciliation record* names
  the file each pass resolved against). **Where no earlier pass answered it and its entry in that
  file carries a `- **Re-escalates:** <earlier self-review file> [SR#k]` line**
  (`/product-workflows:brd-package`, *The disposition gate*) — a line written only where the operator
  confirmed, beside both findings' words, that the two are the same finding — the finding was put
  to the customer before under that other id: resolve `[SR#k]` of the named file the same way — its
  own line
  followed in turn — and the chain starts at what that resolves to, so the new answer is judged
  against the earlier answer's live record. **Where nothing resolves** — no pass answered the id or
  one it re-escalates, or the pass that did names no file it resolved against — the `[SR#n]` has no
  live record: nothing is skipped, and its answer is frozen as a new `[CD#n]` that supersedes
  nothing. An entry written before the line existed carries none, and is frozen fresh the same
  way. A `--sent` run resolves no
  `[SR#n]` at all (*Resolve inputs and gate the sent package*, step 8).

While that record reads `superseded`, follow its closing `Superseded <YYYYMMDD>: by [CD#m]`
paragraph to its successor, however it came to be superseded — by a later review's answer, or by the
answer to a question a `- **Re-puts:**` line put again. Those records are the target's **chain**,
and the one it stops at is the **live record**: the one this phase compares a confirmed candidate
against, and the one the *Freeze the customer decisions* phase acts on (its steps 2 and 3); nothing
on an earlier record of the chain is read for a status or written. **A successor is never a torn
write**: an `[AS#n]` and a `[CD#n]` are superseded only by a `[CD#m]` (`decision-register-format.md`
§4), and a `[CD#n]` is never torn (§8). A torn link can only be where the chain starts — a torn
entry or a torn `[AS#n]` — and a candidate answering one was already carried `unmatched` (*Resolve
inputs and gate the sent package*, step 8), so it resolves nothing here. A target with no record at
all — a held entry no answer was frozen against and no `- **Re-puts:**` line names a record for, or
an `[SR#n]` with no live record — has no live record. **Two targets whose chains end at one live
record are one question from here on**, for the conflicting-answer picker below and for the tests
that follow it: one review can cite both an original entry and the later entry that put its record
again, and both answers reach the same record.

**A different review re-affirming a live answer freezes nothing, and the test runs on the row the
operator confirmed.** A corrected resend re-answers every question it did not change, and the rule
above does not reach it, since it is not the same review. Which option an answer chooses is the
*Freeze the customer decisions* phase's mapping — `chosen` is one member of what was put, or the
marked outside-the-options form (`decision-register-format.md` §1) — and mapping a customer's words
onto an option is inference, so **no re-affirmation test runs on the reader's row**. The candidate
is shown on the four-option array like any other, its live record beside it; the test runs once the
operator takes *Confirm* or *Correct it*, after the conflicting-answer picker below where that
picker is put, on the row that choice confirmed: its `chosen` as the *Freeze* phase would write it,
and its reason — in free-text mode a `reason: not stated` included, which the operator confirms with
the row, since the reader may have missed a reason the quotation holds and *Correct it* is where one
is supplied. An unconfirmed row never skips. The confirmed candidate **re-affirms** its live record,
and is recorded rather than frozen, where:

- the live record is **`decided`**, with or without `conditional_on`, and the candidate's `chosen`
  equals the record's `chosen` and its reason, as the *Freeze* phase would quote it, is byte-equal
  to the record's quoted reason once every run of whitespace on either side is collapsed to one
  space; or
- the live record is a `[CD#n]` that is `decided` or `open` — frozen `open` for want of its reason,
  or held `open` by the will-change rule — and the candidate's `chosen` equals the record's `chosen`
  and it states no reason at all. A missing reason is not a different reason: what the record holds
  stands — the customer's reason, or the want of one that keeps it `open` — so such a candidate
  never reaches the missing-reason picker above, which would otherwise offer to replace a whole
  answer with half of one.

The record's quoted reason is the customer's words its `argumentation` closes on — everything after
the last paragraph this plugin wrote there, a `Reopened`, `Superseded`, `Reverted` or `Withdrawn`
paragraph (`decision-register-format.md` §4) or the note naming the reason absent that a record
frozen through the missing-reason picker above carries, or the whole field where it holds none. A
record whose `argumentation` closes on a plugin paragraph has no quoted reason to compare, and nor
does the first test hold where it cannot be told which words are the customer's: every doubt falls
to the new answer. A re-affirmation is reported as *already reconciled, re-affirmed by* `<review
file>`, naming the canonicalised review, suffix included, and is listed so in the reconciliation
record; it mints no `[CD#n]`, appends no *answered by the customer*, and adds nothing to the
propagation sweep's changed-id set, because nothing changed.

**Anything short of a re-affirmation is a new answer to the live record's question**, and the
*Freeze the customer decisions* phase acts on the live record with it by that record's status: a
`decided` one is superseded (step 3); one frozen `open` for want of its reason is **completed**
where the confirmed `chosen` equals its own and a reason is now stated, and **superseded** by a new
`[CD#n]` where the `chosen` differs, with a reason or without one — the customer chose again, which
D1 settles as a new answer (*Completing an `open` record*, below); one the will-change rule held
`open` is superseded; a `reopened` one is replaced by the new answer, or, where the answered entry
names it on a `- **Re-puts:**` line, re-decided in place (step 3); an `[AS#n]` still open is
superseded as step 2 sets out. A different `chosen` given with no reason takes the missing-reason
picker above first. **Never tested at all**: a target with no live record, and an entry not yet
answered that puts a record again on a `- **Re-puts:**` line, whatever its live record — that
question was put again because the record could not stand on the ground it was decided on, so its
first answer replaces the record, either kind of `open` included, even where the customer chose the
same option again (step 3).

**A live record reading `withdrawn` takes no answer at all.** Its question stopped applying, so the
candidate is not put on the four-option array and nothing is frozen from it: it is shown with the
same facts, the withdrawn record beside it, on the two-option array an answer matching no question
takes (above). *Record it for a human* names it under *what still needs a human* with the customer's
words and the withdrawn record — whether an answer to a question that had stopped applying still
stands is a judgement this run does not take — and, where the answered entry is a held one whose `-
**Re-puts:**` line put again a record since withdrawn, the *Freeze the customer decisions* phase's
step 1 closes that entry *answered by the customer*, naming the withdrawn record and that nothing
was frozen from the answer, so its round can close. *Reject* moves nothing, as it does anywhere:
such an entry stays held, the next package puts it again, and the way out is a
`/product-workflows:brd-interview` round, which can drop the question or take it otherwise (the
*Reject* paragraph above).

**Completing an `open` record is not minting a new one — and only a record open for want of its
reason, answered with its own `chosen`, is completed.** Where a later review supplies the reason a
`[CD#n]` was frozen `open` for, and chooses what that record chose — never on an entry that puts a
record again on a `- **Re-puts:**` line, where it is superseded (step 3) — the missing
`argumentation` is written onto **that record**, which moves to `decided` — unless the *Freeze the
customer decisions*
phase's will-change rule, tested on it before it is written `decided`, holds it open. Ids are
assigned once and never reused (§1), and one record holds one `chosen` — a second id for the same
answer would leave two on the page with nothing to adjudicate between them. **A different `chosen`
is not a missing half**: writing its reason onto the old record would append a reason to a choice it
does not argue for, so it mints a new `[CD#n]` and the *Freeze the customer decisions* phase's step
3 supersedes the open record with it. **A record the will-change rule held open is never
completed**: it already carries the customer's `chosen` and `argumentation`, so a later review's
answer against it is a new answer — possibly a different `chosen` — and not a missing half. It takes
the *Freeze the customer decisions* phase's step 3 instead: a new `[CD#n]`, the earlier record
`superseded` by it — and only that: a record held `open` was never `decided`, so `reopened`, which
follows `decided` (`decision-register-format.md` §3), is not a status it can take — and the
will-change rule tested on the **new** record.

**Two candidates answering one question are never both frozen.** Where the operator takes *Confirm*
or *Correct it* on a candidate whose target — a `[C]` question by its round and position, an
`[AS#n]` or an escalated `[SR#n]`, as the reader returned it or as the operator re-pointed it —
another candidate of this walk already left on one of those two, neither is frozen as that
question's answer until the operator picks one: two customer answers to one question is a
contradiction one record has no way to hold (above), and the *Freeze the customer decisions* phase
would otherwise meet two answers replacing one record with nothing to choose between them. It is the
shared target that triggers this — or two targets resolving to the same live record (above) — in
both modes; a `conflict` flag the reader raised on the pair is
shown beside them and is not required. **This picker is put before the re-affirmation test and the
missing-reason picker**, and they only to the candidate this one leaves to be frozen; a candidate
the missing-reason picker has already sent back to the customer is not *left on* *Confirm* or
*Correct it*, and so triggers nothing here. Show the two together, each with its quotation, and put:

```
choices: ["Freeze this one — the earlier candidate is set aside as a conflicting answer, for a human", "Keep the earlier one — this one is set aside as a conflicting answer, for a human", "Ask the customer — freeze neither; both take Ask the customer and the question is left as it stands"]
```

The one set aside is not frozen and moves nothing: it is named in the reconciliation record's *what
still needs a human* as a conflicting answer, with the customer's words and the candidate frozen in
its place — or, where the one kept then went back to the customer for its reason, that it did — so whoever takes it up — with the customer, or in a later round — has both. No
`(Recommended)` marker: which of two customer statements is their answer is not the run's to guess,
and *Ask the customer* is not marked either, because a pair the operator can read cleanly is theirs
to settle here. The free-text answer is bounded as on the array above — normalised into the three,
or the pair re-asked — and every later candidate onto the same target is put against whichever candidate was
kept. Where none was — the pair took *Ask the customer*, or the one kept went back to the customer for
its reason — a later candidate onto that target takes *Ask the customer* too, with no picker: the
operator has already sent that question back, and a candidate walked later does not close it.

**The gate.** Any decision in the digest still unconfirmed when this phase would end → stop. A
candidate skipped as already reconciled by the same-review rule is disposed and does not count; one
the operator confirmed and the re-affirmation test then recorded is confirmed, and one whose live
record reads `withdrawn` takes record-for-a-human | reject like an answer matching no question:
`BRD_RECONCILE_UNCONFIRMED: N decisions from the returned review are still unconfirmed — every one takes confirm | correct | reject | ask-the-customer, or, answering no question the package put, record-for-a-human | reject, before a [CD#n] is written.`

---

## Phase 5 — Freeze the customer decisions as `[CD#n]`

Write one `[CD#n]` per confirmed candidate **that is not completing a record that already exists**,
none for one that re-affirms its question's live record, and none for one the *Confirm every
candidate* phase set aside as a conflicting answer.
The *Confirm every candidate* phase's rule is the carve-out and it is repeated here because the mint
and the exception live in two different phases, which is precisely where this would regress: a
candidate confirmed against a target whose live record is an **`open`** `[CD#n]` **open for want of
its reason**, choosing what that record chose and now stating a reason — never on an entry that
puts a record
again on a `- **Re-puts:**` line (step 3), where an open record of either kind is superseded —
**mints nothing** — its
reason is written as the `argumentation` of that record, which moves to `decided` unless the
will-change rule below holds it open. **One choosing differently is not that case**: it is a new
answer (D1) and mints a new `[CD#n]`, which step 3 below sets against the open record. **Nor is a
target whose live record is an `open` record the will-change rule held open** (*Confirm every
candidate*, *Completing an `open` record*): that record already holds a `chosen` and its argument,
so the candidate is a new answer and mints a new `[CD#n]`, which step 3 below sets against the
earlier one. Where the held entry it answers gained a `- **Requirement defect:**` line after that
record was frozen (`/product-workflows:brd-interview`, *One question per row*), the record's
`settles` is written from that line in the same step — copied, as the `settles` row below copies
it, never inferred. **A candidate answering an entry whose `- **Re-puts:**` line names a record
whose live record (*Confirm every candidate*) reads `status: reopened` —
read as the register stood before this phase wrote anything (step 3) — mints nothing either** (`/product-workflows:brd-interview`, *A decision the re-grounding moved* and *A decision reopened elsewhere*): it
re-decides that record in place, under `decision-register-format.md` §4's per-field rules, as step
3's `- **Re-puts:**` paragraph sets out. Ids are
assigned once and never reused (§1), and one record holds one `chosen`. **Where the package was
built by this route, the register is on file here** — `/product-workflows:brd-interview` writes it
on every run that records a round, as its header line alone where no round recorded a decision (§1),
and `/product-workflows:brd-package` gated on it — so a `[CD#n]` is added after whatever records it
holds, and the first one in a header-only register is `[CD#1]`. **Where no register is on file,
this phase creates it before anything else**, as §1's header line alone,
`# Decision register: <BRD-KEY>`, whether or not it then freezes a record. Only a `--sent` run
reaches that: a slice never interviewed holds none (Phase 0 step 2), and nor does one whose rounds,
interviewed before 3.7.0, recorded no decision. A `[CD#n]` frozen there is `[CD#1]`, and a run
that freezes none leaves the register header-only, which every reader takes as a register with
nothing in it (§1). Everything else in this phase is about a genuinely new record, and each carries
every field `decision-register-format.md` §1 defines:

| Field | On a `[CD#n]` this phase writes |
|---|---|
| `id` | `[CD#n]`, contiguous within its own prefix, continuing from the highest `[CD#n]` on file, **never renumbered and never reused** — a re-run continues the sequence and never restarts it |
| `statement` | the decision, one sentence, as confirmed |
| `options_considered` | what the package actually put in front of the customer, taken from the `[C]` question, the `[AS#n]`, or the escalated `[SR#n]` — never reconstructed from the answer, and never widened to take in an answer outside it. A `[C]` question put as yes or no, listing no options, records `["yes", "no"]`; an `[AS#n]`, which puts no options, records `["as assumed", "not as assumed"]`; and an escalated `[SR#n]` records `["as the package states", "as the finding argues"]` (`decision-register-format.md` §1) |
| `chosen` | the customer's answer: one member of `options_considered`, or, where the customer answered outside them (*Confirm every candidate*), their answer quoted after the fixed marker `decision-register-format.md` §1 gives that case, in the quoting form it fixes for an answer spanning lines or carrying a `"` or a `\` |
| `argumentation` | **the customer's own reason, quoted**, never paraphrased and never supplied |
| `evidence` | the `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` the question was put against, as the question set recorded them — for a `[C]` candidate, the ids on the answered question's `- **Findings:**` line in `interview/customer-questions.md` and nothing else in the entry, whose context may name other findings (`/product-workflows:brd-interview`, *Hold every `[C]`*); an entry written before 3.7.0 carries no such line, and its findings are read from its prose where it names them. `evidence: []` where what is read recorded none, never omitted (`decision-register-format.md` §1), and never `[]` because a line that was there could not be parsed |
| `defects` | the `[CDF#n]` the answered position turns on, as the `[C]` question, the `[AS#n]` or the escalated `[SR#n]` recorded them; omitted when none. Never in `evidence` (§1), and **never minted here** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-defect-log-format.md` makes `/product-workflows:brd-interview` the log's only writer, so this phase carries an existing id forward and writes no entry |
| `settles` | the `[DEF#n]` on the answered `[C]` question's `- **Requirement defect:**` line in `interview/customer-questions.md`, copied from that line and from nothing else in the entry, whose context may name other `[DEF#n]`s (`references/decision-register-format.md` §1); omitted where the entry has no such line. **Never inferred from the review**: which question an answer answers is already fixed by the round and position it cites, and the entry is the record of what that question was raised by or carries |
| `altitude` | copied, never judged, wherever there is one to copy: the answered `[C]` question's `- **Altitude:**` line in `interview/customer-questions.md`, an `[AS#n]`'s own `altitude`, or, for an escalated `[SR#n]`, which carries none, the altitude of the record or question its `target` names. Where there is none — a `[C]` entry written before 3.7.0, or an `[SR#n]` whose target is a document passage — decide it by the test `decision-register-format.md` §1 gives the field, the downstream artifact the answer must reach, and name it in the reconciliation record as decided here rather than copied. An answer matching no question is never frozen (*Confirm every candidate*), so it needs no altitude |
| `conditional_on` | written only where the customer's answer is itself correct only while a named prerequisite decision holds, or where the will-change rule below writes it, and named as `<BRD-KEY>/<decision-id>` (§5) — for instance `conditional_on: EPIC-014/[CD#2]` |
| `status` | `decided`, or `open` where the reason is absent and the *Confirm every candidate* phase took that resolution, or where the will-change rule below holds the record open |
| `consumed_by` | `none` |
| `round` | the round that raised the question this answers — **omitted where that is an `[AS#n]` carrying no round**, which is what `/product-workflows:create-prd` writes for a customer-authority gap surfaced at PRD authoring (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §7). Such an answer came from no round, and inventing one here would put a value into the field `/product-workflows:brd-package` derives its round set from |

**The will-change rule binds a `[CD#n]` exactly as it binds a `[VD#n]` (D19).** Before any record
this phase writes is written `decided` — a new `[CD#n]`, and an `open` one this run completes alike —
test its `evidence` list against `decision-register-format.md` §6, by the test
`/product-workflows:brd-interview`'s *The will-change rule* phase applies and by no other: it fires
when *every* finding in the list carries `horizon: will-change` (`workflows-core:grounding-format`
§5), read off each finding in the grounding file that holds it. It does **not** fire on a list
holding one `current` finding beside `will-change` ones — the `current` finding is ground that
holds — nor on `evidence: []`, which rests on no `will-change` finding either (§6). **The customer
answered; the ground under the answer is about to move**, and a customer's authority does not make a
premise the code is going to falsify any firmer than an operator's does. Where the test fires, the
record is still written — the customer's answer is on it, `chosen` and `argumentation` verbatim as
the table above takes them, never softened and never re-worded — but it is **never written as an
unconditional `decided`**. Of §6's three resolutions this phase takes the second or the third, and
which one is read off the findings rather than asked, because each `will-change` finding already
names the one prerequisite decision that overturns it (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §5):

- **every `will-change` finding in the list names the same prerequisite decision, each carrying its
  BRD key** → §6's second resolution: `conditional_on: <BRD-KEY>/<decision-id>`, naming that
  decision, and `status: decided` — the form `/product-workflows:brd-interview` records that
  resolution in. The propagation sweep then reaches the record by its field the day that
  prerequisite's decision moves (§5).
- **they name more than one** → §6's third resolution: `status: open`. `conditional_on` holds one
  decision (§5), and naming one of several would record a dependency narrower than the one the
  answer has. The blocking prerequisites are named by the record's own `evidence`, each finding
  naming the decision that overturns it, and outright in the reconciliation record.
- **any of them carries a `prerequisite` that does not carry its BRD key** — a bare `[VD#n]` or
  `[CD#n]`, which `workflows-core:grounding-format` §5 does not forbid → §6's third resolution as
  well: `status: open`, whatever the other findings name. `conditional_on` must name
  `<BRD-KEY>/<decision-id>` (§5), and an unqualified value does not say which BRD's decision it
  is: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.2 reports such a value and never
  resolves it, because a bare id matches a record of the wrong register and resolves green. So the
  run **never parses or guesses a key out of it** — not from this slice's own key, not from its
  `depends-on:`, not from the finding's prose — and names the unqualified value, with the finding
  carrying it, under *what still needs a human*, where a person who knows which BRD it means can
  qualify it and re-ground.

**§6's first resolution is never taken here**: re-basing the answer on a `current` finding changes
its `evidence`, and a `[CD#n]`'s evidence is copied from the question the customer was put and from
nothing else — a list this run changed would name ground the customer was never shown. **Either way
the record goes under *what still needs a human*** in the reconciliation record, with its findings,
the prerequisite decision or decisions they name, and the resolution taken. A record held `open` here
is `open` like any other (§3): nothing downstream consumes it. **Its question, though, is answered**
— the customer did answer it, and the record carries that answer and their reason — so step 1 below
closes it as *answered by the customer* exactly as it closes one whose record is `decided`, and its
round can close. Holding the question would be worse than pointless: **another answer to the question
as put never settles it** — the new record's `evidence` is the question's too, so the test fires on it
again and it is held open in turn, superseding this one (step 3) — and a round held open around it would keep `/product-workflows:brd-interview` resuming that round
for good and never propose the later one that is this record's exit. What does close it is the
prerequisite shipping, a `/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> --rebaseline` pass whose findings
supersede the `will-change` ones **with successors that no longer carry `horizon: will-change`** —
a pass run before the prerequisite ships supersedes them too, but its successors are `will-change`
still, and the record keeps waiting — and a later `/product-workflows:brd-interview` round, proposed
in the ordinary way once every round is closed, that puts the question against those findings, on an
entry whose `- **Re-puts:**` line names this record, whose answer, frozen by a later run of this
command, then supersedes this record under step 3; the reconciliation record names that sequence
beside it. **A record written `conditional_on` has a second exit**: it is `decided`, so the
propagation sweep of the prerequisite's own reconciliation reaches it by that field the day that
decision moves, and may revert it or reopen it in place (*The propagation sweep*;
`decision-register-format.md` §5). A record held `open` carries no `conditional_on`, so the sweep's
field pass never reaches it; its citation pass may, where the record names a changed id, and may
withdraw or revert it (*The propagation sweep*). Otherwise its exit is the round.

**A `[BR#n]` this slice does not claim is written qualified, as `<PARENT-KEY> [BR#n]`, in every
field this phase writes save the customer's own words** — `/product-workflows:brd-interview`'s rule
(*A row this slice does not claim*), which reads a row's form off this slice's inventory, binds
everything written from a question, and so binds the `[CD#n]` that answers one. `<PARENT-KEY>` is
this slice's `parent:`, and the form is the one prose spelling
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.2 gives another BRD's id. That is
`statement` above all — this run's own sentence, *as confirmed*, which names a sibling's row or one
the parent settled wherever the question did — and `options_considered`, with a `chosen` naming one
of its members: a question that rule wrote is copied as it stands, and one naming such a row bare —
recorded before 3.7.0, or put by a package this route did not build — is qualified as it is copied,
the key put before the id and nothing else changed, since the id already carried the parent's
numbering. The register ships in this slice's next package, whose citation-resolution check resolves
a bare `[BR#n]` against this slice's inventory alone and stops on one naming a row outside it. **The
customer's own words are never requalified**: `argumentation`, and a `chosen` quoted after its
marker, stay exactly as the customer wrote them — a quotation changed is a falsified record — and
`bundle-packaging.md` §6.3 reports a hit inside either rather than stopping on it.

**What "frozen" means, exactly.** A `[CD#n]` written `decided` leaves that status only through
§4's two admitted causes — a new grounding finding, or a later incoming customer decision that
contradicts or constrains it — or through supersession by a later answer to its own question (§4;
step 3 below), each recorded with its cause. This command is one of those causes for *other*
decisions and is never a cause for the record it has just written: a run does not reopen its own
freeze.

Then, in the same phase and from the same confirmed set:

1. **Close each `[C]` in the round record.** A question whose answer this run froze moves from the
   holding state *held for the customer* to the terminal disposition **answered by the customer**,
   naming the `[CD#n]` it produced. Append it; never rewrite what the round originally asked, or
   anything else an earlier write of the record holds. **This is the only thing that can close such
   a round**, and it is why the round stays open from the moment `/brd-interview` holds a `[C]`
   until this command runs: holding a question is not the customer answering it, and the customer
   answering it is not the register recording an answer (`interview-tagging.md` §5, `decision-register-format.md` §1). Mark the same question answered in
   `interview/customer-questions.md`, naming the `[CD#n]`. **A question an earlier review already
   answered has no holding state to leave**: where this run's answer to it replaces that record
   (step 3) and is frozen `decided` or held `open` by the will-change rule, a further *answered by
   the customer*, naming the new `[CD#n]`, is appended beneath the one already there, in the round
   record and in `interview/customer-questions.md` alike — a later resend's chain to the live
   record runs through each in turn (*Confirm every candidate*) — and its round takes no
   `Status:` line on its account, since the answer closed no held question. **A held entry whose
   `- **Re-puts:**` line put again a record since withdrawn is closed too, with nothing frozen**:
   where *Confirm every candidate* recorded its answer for a human because the entry's live record
   reads `withdrawn`, it moves to *answered by the customer*, naming the withdrawn record and that
   nothing was frozen from the answer — the customer did answer, and the question they answered had
   stopped applying — and counts toward closing its round as below. Held, it would be put to the
   customer again in every package for a record nothing can revive.

   **Where that leaves every question in the round with a terminal disposition** — its last held
   question closed, and no question in another holding state — append
   `Status: closed <YYYYMMDD> — <why>` after it, with this run's date and, for `<why>`, the held
   questions this run's answers closed. A round's state is decided by its questions' dispositions,
   and its **last** `Status:` line is where each write records it
   (`/product-workflows:brd-interview`, *Write the register and the round record*), so any
   `Status: open` line `/brd-interview` wrote above stays where it is, as history. Where any
   question in the round is left without a terminal disposition — still held, or in another holding
   state — append no `Status:` line: the round was open and stays open. Its last line may then name
   a holding state no question is in any more, *held for the customer* after this run answered the
   last held question; the dispositions win over it, and the next `/brd-interview` write of the
   record appends a line that agrees (`/product-workflows:brd-interview`, *Write the register and
   the round record*).

   **A question whose `[CD#n]` is `open` for want of its reason is not answered, and its holding
   state does not move.** The customer's answer came back without the reason that makes it
   defensible, and nobody may supply it (*Confirm every candidate*), so the answer is not yet
   whole. A held one stays *held for the customer*, the round stays open, and the next package puts
   it to the customer again — which is precisely how the missing reason gets chased. Closing the
   round here would retire the only mechanism that would ever ask for it. **A question an earlier
   review already answered is not held again**: where this run's answer to it — a different
   `chosen`, given with no reason — replaces its live record with one frozen `open` for want of its
   reason (step 3), it keeps the *answered by the customer* it holds and its round is not reopened.
   No package puts an answered question, so nothing chases that reason on its own: the record goes
   under *what still needs a human* as open for want of a reason, and a later review that supplies
   it reaches it, since it is that question's live record (*Confirm every candidate*). **A question
   whose `[CD#n]` the will-change rule above held open is the opposite case, and is closed like a
   `decided` one**: the customer answered it whole, `chosen` and reason, and what keeps the record
   `open` is ground that is about to move, which nothing the customer can add would change. So it
   moves to *answered by the customer*, naming that `[CD#n]`, and counts toward closing its round
   as above. Holding it would chase nothing, and would keep the round open around a question no
   package can settle — and `/product-workflows:brd-interview` works the lowest open round and
   proposes a new one only once every round is closed, so the later round the will-change rule
   names as this record's exit could never be proposed. The record itself stays `open`, and the
   reconciliation record lists it under *what still needs a human* with that exit.
2. **Supersede the assumptions the customer settled.** An `[AS#n]` the customer confirms does not
   silently become a fact and an `[AS#n]` they contradict does not silently disappear: both are
   `superseded` by the `[CD#n]` that answers them, which the record names in a closing
   `Superseded <YYYYMMDD>: by [CD#m]` paragraph appended to its `argumentation`; nothing else on it
   moves (`decision-register-format.md` §4, §7). An assumption whose row said `cannot-say` is **not**
   superseded — cannot-say is a real answer and not a settlement — and it stays open and travels
   into the next package. **An `[AS#n]` an earlier review already settled is not superseded
   again**, and nothing on it moves: an answer to it resolves to its live record — the `[CD#m]` its
   `Superseded` paragraph names, followed to that record's own successor (*Confirm every
   candidate*) — and step 3 acts on that `[CD#n]` as on any other.
3. **Reopen what the answer overturned, here — and `[CD#n]` is in scope, not only `[VD#n]`.** Every
   `decided` record in **this** BRD's register that the frozen answer contradicts or constrains
   without replacing it takes `status: reopened`, naming that `[CD#n]` as its cause (where more than
   one answer does, it is reopened once, naming every one of them — below). What a record
   the answer replaces takes, and one held `open` or already `reopened`, is set out below, and one
   already `superseded` or `withdrawn` is terminal (§3) and takes nothing here. §4 admits an
   incoming customer decision as one of its two causes and §3's statuses govern "each `[VD#n]`
   **and** `[CD#n]`", so a customer decision that contradicts an *earlier customer decision* is
   squarely inside the rule. A reopening whose cause is unnamed is indistinguishable from somebody
   changing their mind. The same test applied to **other** BRDs is the propagation sweep's, and it
   is deliberately not run here: this BRD's own register is the one this phase is already holding
   open.

   **The case this exists for is the corrected resend, which the *Canonicalise the returned review*
   phase calls an ordinary state.** Two reviews of one date, or a corrected file weeks later, both
   answer the same `[C]` — and the *Confirm every candidate* phase freezes nothing from a different
   review's candidate that re-affirms its question's live record, or whose live record is
   `withdrawn`, by the tests that phase sets out; every other confirmed one is frozen. Without
   this step that mints a second `decided` `[CD#n]` for one question, and **two customer answers to
   one question is a contradiction one record has no way to hold**
   (`decision-register-format.md` §1, `interview-tagging.md` §5) — the failure the whole register is
   shaped to prevent, arriving through the affordance built to accept a correction. **The record an
   answer acts on here is its target's live record** (*Confirm every candidate*): where the record
   the entry's answer, the `[AS#n]` or the `- **Re-puts:**` line first reaches was superseded, the
   chain is followed to its successor, and nothing on an earlier record of the chain moves.

   **What the earlier record takes depends on what the new answer does to it and on the status it
   holds**, and every outcome is a §3 status or no move at all, never anything invented here:
   - the new answer **replaces** it — it answers the record's own question again, whatever it
     chooses → `superseded`, naming the `[CD#n]` that replaces it in the closing
     `Superseded <YYYYMMDD>: by [CD#m]` paragraph `decision-register-format.md` §4 fixes; nothing
     else on it moves. Terminal; the id is retained, never reused. On a `decided` record the same
     option chosen again replaces it as surely as another does: the same `chosen` with a different
     reason is a new answer. An exact repeat of a `decided` record — the same `chosen` and the same
     quoted reason — reaches this step where *Confirm every candidate*'s re-affirmation test does
     not hold it back: where the record's `argumentation` closes on a plugin paragraph, or where the
     entry answered puts the record again on a `- **Re-puts:**` line. It then replaces the record
     like any other answer.
   - the new answer **contradicts or constrains without replacing** it — it bears on the record's
     question without answering that question again → `reopened`, naming its cause, and it is
     re-decided like any other reopened record. **Only a record that is `decided` can take this**:
     `reopened` follows `decided` (`decision-register-format.md` §3), so a record the will-change
     rule held `open`, one frozen `open` for want of its reason, and one already `reopened` cannot.
     Which of them an answer to the record's own question replaces is not the same for all three.
     **A record the will-change rule held `open` is replaced by it** and takes the first bullet
     (*Completing an `open` record*). **One frozen `open` for want of its reason** is completed,
     minting nothing, by an answer choosing what it chose and now stating a reason (the mint rule
     above) — never on an entry that puts a record again on a `- **Re-puts:**` line, where it is
     superseded (below) —
     and replaced by one choosing differently, which takes the first bullet. **A `reopened`
     one named on the answered entry's `- **Re-puts:**` line is re-decided in place** (below); one
     the answered entry does not name that way — a corrected resend of the review that first
     answered it — is replaced by the new answer and takes the first bullet. Where the answer
     contradicts or constrains any of the three without replacing it, its `status` does not move —
     `superseded` would record an answer to its question that nobody gave (§3) — and it is named,
     with the constraining `[CD#n]`, under *what still needs a human*. One the rule wrote
     `conditional_on` its prerequisite is `decided` and takes either bullet.

   Say which, per record, in the reconciliation record — superseded, reopened, or left at its status
   with the constraining `[CD#n]` named: each leaves very different work behind, and the reader who
   has to do it cannot tell them apart from the fact that a second `[CD#n]` exists.

   **An answer to a question that puts a record again acts on that record, and the entry says
   which.** Where the answered `[C]` entry carries a `- **Re-puts:** [CD#n]` line
   (`/product-workflows:brd-interview`, *A decision the re-grounding moved*), the record the line
   names is read off the line and never judged — the line is the one this reads, never the entry's
   context, which names the earlier answer too — and **its `status` decides what the answer does**:
   - **`open` or `decided`** — a `[CD#n]` this phase's will-change rule froze `open` or
     `conditional_on` its prerequisite, whose `will-change` findings a re-grounding has since
     superseded with successors no longer `will-change` → `superseded` by the new `[CD#n]`, with
     its closing `Superseded <YYYYMMDD>: by [CD#m]` paragraph. It is the first bullet above whatever
     the new answer's wording: the question was put again because that record could not stand on
     the ground that moved, so the new answer is its replacement even where the customer chose the
     same option again.
   - **`reopened`** — a `decided` record `/product-workflows:brd-interview` reopened because a
     re-grounding superseded a finding of its `evidence` and the successors did not confirm it; one
     reopened before any question put it — by step 3 of an earlier run of this command, by another
     BRD's propagation sweep, or by a `/product-workflows:brd-interview` run that stopped before
     writing its question — whose question that command's *A decision reopened elsewhere* put; or
     one a propagation sweep reopened since the question was put → **re-decided in place**, minting
     no id:
     `statement`, `options_considered`, `chosen`, `evidence` (the answered entry's
     `- **Findings:**` line, as the table above takes it), `defects`, `conditional_on` and `status`
     are written afresh as the table above takes each, the will-change rule tested on it like any
     record written `decided`; the customer's reason, quoted, is appended to `argumentation`
     beneath the `Reopened` paragraph and never over it; `round` becomes the round of the question
     it answers; `consumed_by` returns to `none`; `id`, `altitude` and `settles` stand
     (`decision-register-format.md` §4). The defect its `settles` names keeps the resolution Phase 8
     wrote when the record was first written `decided` — frozen so, or completed from `open` — and
     *Resolve the defects the review settled* writes none for it. Step 1 closes the question naming
     this `[CD#n]`.
   - **`superseded`** — another answer replaced the record while the question putting it again
     travelled, a corrected resend's among them → nothing on it is written, and the answer acts on
     its **live record** (*Confirm every candidate*) by that record's status, under these bullets,
     as though the line named it: a successor `decided` or `open` — either kind, one frozen `open`
     for want of its reason included, which is superseded here and never completed — is superseded
     even where the customer chose the same option again, for the first bullet's reason — it
     answers the question as it stood before it was put again — and a `reopened` one is re-decided
     in place.
   - **`withdrawn`**, the named record or its live successor — terminal
     (`decision-register-format.md` §3), reachable where the prerequisite's own propagation sweep
     withdrew a record held `conditional_on` it while the question travelled → **its `status` does
     not move**, nothing on it is written, and **nothing is frozen**: *Confirm every candidate* put
     the answer on the two-option array, not the four, and on *Record it for a human* named it, with
     the customer's words and the withdrawn record, under *what still needs a human* — whether an
     answer to a question that had stopped applying still stands is a judgement this run does not
     take — and step 1 closes the entry, naming the withdrawal, so its round can close.

   **Every status this step and the mint rule above read is the register's as it stood before this
   phase wrote anything**, never one an earlier candidate's write in this same phase left — so the
   outcome does not depend on the order the confirmed candidates are taken in. That matters where
   one run's answers reach one record more than once. **Where one candidate's entry names the record
   on a `- **Re-puts:**` line** — or a record the chain from it reaches — and any other answer also
   bears on it — replacing it, contradicting it or constraining it — **the `- **Re-puts:**` line
   decides that record**, by the status it held before this phase, as the bullets above set out —
   it names the record the question was put again to settle, and the others only bear on it — and
   every other candidate takes nothing further on it: once the line has acted, the record is
   terminal, or this run's own freeze, which a run does not reopen (*What "frozen" means,
   exactly*). Each other `[CD#n]` is frozen as it would be anyway. **Where no answer's entry names
   the record on such a line** — one answer replacing it, others contradicting or constraining it
   without replacing it — **the one that replaces it decides it**, as the bullets above set out for
   the status it held before this phase: `superseded` by that `[CD#n]`, or,
   where it was frozen `open` for want of its reason and that answer chooses what it chose,
   completed by it (the mint rule above); a terminal record takes nothing. The constraining answers
   take nothing further on it. **Where two or more answers contradict or constrain one `decided`
   record and none replaces it or names it on such a line**, it is `reopened` once, its `Reopened`
   paragraph naming every such `[CD#n]` as the cause: one record takes one reopening, and a second
   `Reopened` paragraph would record two reopenings where there was one. A record that is not
   `decided` stays at its status, as the bullets above set out, however many answers constrain it.
   **In every one of these cases the record is named under *what still needs a human* with every
   `[CD#n]` that reached it.** **Two answers each replacing one record, neither naming it on such a
   line, do not reach this step as two**: such an answer answers the record's own question, and
   *Confirm every candidate* lets only one candidate per question leave it to be frozen — the other
   is set aside there as a conflicting answer.

   A `[VD#n]` put again is not this command's: its question is a `[V]`, and
   `/product-workflows:brd-interview` supersedes or re-decides it.
4. **Record an answered `[SR#n]`.** A finding disposed `escalated-to-customer` and answered in
   section 7 produces a `[CD#n]` like any other, whose record names the `[SR#n]` it answers. That is
   not this command minting a `[C]`: it mints no question at all, and records an answer to one the
   package already put. The dated self-review holding that `[SR#n]` is **bannered, never rewritten**
   — the next phase but one.

**No `[VD#n]` and no `[AS#n]` is created by this command, ever.** A delivery-team position is
`/brd-interview`'s to take, with its own argumentation prompt, and a customer answer does not become
a `[VD#n]` because it was inconvenient to freeze — which prefix a decision gets is fixed by the tag
of the question it answers, never by who typed it (§1).

## Phase 6 — Apply the required corrections

The review's section 12 is **the only channel a returned review has for changing a package
document** (D13, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/customer-review-schema.md` §3): the one-new-file
rule closes every other one, so each row is an *instruction to edit* naming the document by filename,
the section or identifier inside it, and what must change. This phase is where those instructions are
carried out — or refused, on the record.

**Every row takes exactly one disposition, and the phase gates on it:**

| Disposition | What it obliges |
|---|---|
| `applied` | The named artifact is corrected, and the correction is recorded against the review row that asked for it. A row marked `applied` whose artifact is unchanged is not applied |
| `applied-with-deviation` | The change is made differently from the way the row describes; what was done and why it differs is recorded, so the customer can see it in the next package rather than discover it |
| `refused-with-reason` | The reason is recorded and travels into the reconciliation record. A refusal the customer never sees is a refusal they will re-request next round |
| `deferred-to-next-round` | The change is real and cannot be made now; what blocks it is named, and the row is carried into the reconciliation record's *what still needs a human* |

Any row still undisposed when this phase would end → stop:
`BRD_RECONCILE_UNDISPOSED_CORRECTION: N required changes from the review are still undisposed — every row takes applied | applied-with-deviation | refused-with-reason | deferred-to-next-round.`

**Three classes of target, and they are not treated alike:**

1. **A live working document.** Corrected in place — these are the documents the route works on, and
   they are supposed to move. **But "live" is not "unowned", and seven of them carry fields another
   rule fixes** — the last, an effort proposal, every line of it. A section-12 row is the customer
   instructing an edit; it is not a licence to write a field this command may not write, and the
   customer cannot know which those are. Split the class:

   | Target | Disposition |
   |---|---|
   | `slices.md`, a seed file, and the **prose** of any document below | Corrected in place. Nothing else owns these |
   | `coverage-ledger.md` — a row's `disposition` | **`refused-with-reason`**, naming the ledger phase as where a `[CD#n]` may move a row and `/product-workflows:brd-split` as the only allocator (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3, §4). A customer asking for a row to be built here is asking for an allocation, and this command writes exactly three dispositions and never `covered-here` or `covered-by`. **Name no command for a row that already carries a fate**: `/brd-split` on this slice walks only `unallocated` rows, and its sibling re-cut runs on the parent, moving only a row a slice deferred and only on an instruction a person gives (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3.2), so no run this record could name allocates it, and the row goes to *what still needs a human* with the customer's words (*Update the coverage ledger*). Only a row still `unallocated` is `/product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY>`'s — a slice this route interviewed never holds one, `/brd-interview` refusing an unallocated ledger, but a `--sent` review of a slice never interviewed can find one |
   | `brd/brd-inventory.md` — a row's `id`, `text` or `source_anchor` | **`refused-with-reason`**, for the reason class 3 gives about `brd/source/` itself: `text` is the requirement **verbatim** from the immutable source — on a row drawn from an image, the element it quotes from that image's transcription — and `source_anchor` locates it there (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1, §2), so rewriting the row edits the customer's document in the one place it is mirrored. The amendment is a `customer-amended` defect resolution, which the *Resolve the defects the review settled* phase writes |
   | `brd/brd-figures.md` — a section's *Text*, *Annotations*, *Flow*, *Illegible* or *Depicts* — **the parent's on a slice**, one hop, as the defect log is (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2.1) | **`applied`**, in place: it is the plugin's reading of the customer's image, not the customer's document, and the reviewer is the reader certain to know what their own picture says — text the transcription recorded as illegible is the likeliest correction. The corrected part is written in the form `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1.2 fixes for it — *Text* the image's own strings only, inside its fenced `text` block, *Flow* one list item per edge in `figure-reader`'s notation, a label with no mark around it — so a corrected labelled edge cannot bring a bracketed label back. The image itself is class 3 below and never touched. On a slice this write takes the cross-BRD write guard above, and **where the guard stops it the row is `deferred-to-next-round`**, naming the branch/PR state the gate reported — never `applied`, because a row marked `applied` whose artifact is unchanged is not applied. A later `/product-workflows:brd-intake` run keeps the corrected section while the image's bytes are unchanged, since its Phase 2.5 re-uses a section whose content hash still matches; a changed image is re-transcribed and the correction does not carry over. **Where the correction changes the element an image-drawn inventory row quotes, that row is not rewritten and no defect is closed**: a corrected transcription is not corrected requirement text, so the *Resolve the defects the review settled* phase writes nothing for it, and any defect the row carries — typically an `ambiguity` about whether the image binds at all — stays open for its own question. The row goes to *what still needs a human*, named with the corrected element. A section-12 row asking to edit the inventory row itself still takes the row above's `refused-with-reason` |
   | `brd/brd-figures.md` — a section's *Read*, *Appearance*, *Content hash*, *Linked from* or *Rows* line | **`refused-with-reason`**, naming `/product-workflows:brd-intake` as their writer: *Read* and *Appearance* record what `figure-reader` could open and what the image looks like, the hash is of the image's bytes, and *Linked from* and *Rows* are written by every intake from its own walk and the final inventory — *Rows* kept as it stood only by an `EMPTY` read, which extracted nothing to write it from (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1.2) — none of them is a reading of the picture a customer can correct, and an edit to the last two says something a later intake overwrites |
   | `decisions.md` — **any field of a record**: the complete set `decision-register-format.md` §4 names, all thirteen, `argumentation` among them | **`refused-with-reason`** where the row asks for a direct edit — the set is cited rather than listed, so a field §4 adds is refused on the day it is added and no field of §1's thirteen falls through this row as prose. Those move only through this command's own freeze, §4's two reopening causes, the propagation sweep's four dispositions, or — for `consumed_by` alone — the stamp `/product-workflows:create-prd`, `/product-workflows:create-ard` and `/product-workflows:specify` each write on a record they drew on. A customer who wants a decision changed has already changed it: their answer is a `[CD#n]`, frozen in the *Freeze the customer decisions* phase, which reopens what it contradicts |
   | `code-defect-log.md` — a `[CDF#n]`'s `disposition` or `blocked_on`, **and its `statement`/`intent` prose too** | **`refused-with-reason`**, and with an effort proposal (the last row) alone among the rows here its prose is not corrected in place either: every disposition on this log is the **operator's** (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-defect-log-format.md` §4), and `/product-workflows:brd-interview` is its only writer. The customer sees every entry because the log ships in the bundle (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §1.1) — seeing is not deciding. Surface the row to the operator naming the entry and what was asked, so a later interview round settles it on the record rather than the customer's channel writing a disposition nobody on the delivery side took |
   | `brd-link.md` — `parent:` or `claims:` | **`refused-with-reason`**. Both are written by `/product-workflows:brd-split`, and `claims:` disagreeing with the ledger is the state the whole allocation gate exists to prevent. `depends-on:` is prose-adjacent and merged additively by `/product-workflows:prd-ground` and `/product-workflows:brd-package`; a row asking to add one is `applied`, merged the same additive way — the one field of `brd-link.md` this command writes |
   | `proposal.md` or `proposal-brief.md` — a slice's or the umbrella's, **any line of it, its prose included**, and every archived revision of either under `revisions/` — reachable where a `--sent` package carried one, since a package `/product-workflows:brd-package` builds carries none | **`refused-with-reason`**, and the file is **never edited**, for the reason the stale cross-reference sweep's proposal row gives: a proposal moves only by a revision, the next run of the command that wrote it archiving the prior revision and classifying every moved figure as a **re-estimate** and every withdrawn or contradicted statement as a **correction** (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §2, §12), and an edit in place changes what the customer was sent with neither the archive nor the classification to show it. Name that run as the remedy, as the sweep's row does — `/product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>` for a slice's proposal, `<SLICE-KEY>` being the slice whose folder holds it, and `/product-workflows:brd-proposal <PARENT-KEY>` for the umbrella in the parent's folder, the slice's first where both are named — and carry the row, with the customer's words, into *what still needs a human*. A row naming only an archived revision names no re-run: the revision is history |

   **A refusal here is not a refusal of the customer's point.** In every row above the substance
   reaches the register through the channel that owns it — a `[CD#n]`, a defect resolution, a later
   `/brd-interview` round, the next intake, a re-run of the command that wrote a proposal, or, for an
   allocation no command can make, a person named in *what still needs a human* — and the refusal
   says which, so the next package shows the customer their point landed rather than that it was
   declined. What is refused is the *edit*, not the *change*. Saying so is the difference between a
   refusal the customer accepts and one they re-request next round.

   **This is the same carve-out the stale cross-reference sweep carries**, and it is written twice
   deliberately: that sweep reaches these files by a text match this command made, while this phase
   reaches them by an instruction the **customer** wrote. The second is the channel with external
   authority behind it, so it is the one more likely to be exercised and the worse one to leave open.
   **The sweep's effort-proposal row has its twin here too**, the last row above, though the route
   seldom reaches it: a section-12 row names a document of the package, and a package
   `/product-workflows:brd-package` builds carries no proposal — but `--sent` admits material this
   route did not build, and that material can carry one.
2. **A dated snapshot** — `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md`, `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md`,
   `customer-delivery-note-<YYYYMMDD>.md`, `interview/round-<N>.md`, anything under
   `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/` or under `customer-sent-<YYYYMMDD>/`, an earlier
   `reconciliation-<YYYYMMDD>.md`. **Never rewritten.** The next
   phase says what happens instead and why.
3. **`brd/source/` and `brd/source-external/`** — the customer's own document and every file
   captured with it, images included. **Never touched at all** (D11,
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1.1). A correction to the source is a defect
   resolution beside it, which the *Resolve the defects the review settled* phase writes. Editing
   the customer's document destroys the ability to say precisely what they gave us and what we
   changed, and a review row asking for it is asking for something this workflow does not do —
   refuse it with that reason, and say that the amendment is held in the returned review this run
   reconciled, which the defect's `customer-amended <SLICE-KEY> <date>` resolution names.

**A correction that would change a `[CG#n]` or a `[DG#n]` is not applied here.** The review's
sections 5 and 6 challenge code and design claims, and the delivery side re-adjudicates them
(`customer-review-schema.md` §5) — but re-adjudication means an independent re-derivation, which only
`/prd-ground` performs. Every such challenge is recorded verbatim, in the reviewer's own words, and
named in the reconciliation record with the concrete next step: a
`/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY>` run, with `--rebaseline` where the repository has moved since
the pin.

---

## Phase 7 — Banner the superseded dated snapshots (D10)

**A dated snapshot is bannered, never rewritten.** A banner is a block prepended above the file's
first line, stating: the date the file records; what has superseded it, by identifier; which of this
run's changes did the superseding; and where the current position is now recorded. **Nothing beneath
the banner changes, byte for byte.** A second reconciliation adds a second banner beneath the first;
a banner is never edited and never replaced.

The reason is D10's and it survives being read in isolation: **a dated self-review or review prompt
is the record of what was asked on the day, and the customer's review responds to that text.**
Rewriting it to match a later position falsifies the record their review answers — and then every
quotation in the returned review points at a sentence that no longer exists, so nothing the customer
said can be checked against what they were actually sent. The delivery team is left holding a review
of a document it has quietly replaced, and nobody can tell which sentences moved.

**Which files this phase banners:** the folder-level `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md`,
`customer-delivery-note-<YYYYMMDD>.md` and `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` whose content this run's
`[CD#n]`, corrections or sweep dispositions have overturned, and any earlier
`reconciliation-<YYYYMMDD>.md` a later pass has superseded.

**And the one place a banner is refused: inside `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/`.** That directory is the
permanent record of exactly what was sent, and its whole value is that it is **byte-identical to the
customer's copy** — which is what makes D13's property checkable months later (D18,
`bundle-packaging.md` §5). A banner is a modification like any other, so bannering the bundle would
break the one property the bundle exists to hold. D10 and D13 partition cleanly and neither is
weakened: D10 governs the dated artifacts the delivery team keeps beside the bundle, D13 governs the
bundle itself. The overturned bundle document is named in the reconciliation record instead, and the
banner on the folder-level prompt says outright that the bundle's own copy is the unbannered
original and is the one to quote from.

**The round records are neither bannered nor corrected: they are appended to.**
`interview/round-<N>.md` is append-only by `/brd-interview`'s own rule, and this run appends the
terminal disposition each answered question reaches, plus the `Status:` line that closes the round
where it does (*Freeze the customer decisions*) — the questions and tags it recorded stand exactly as
they were asked, and every other line an earlier write put there stands as it was written. An append is how an append-only record moves on, and its last `Status:` line
records the state its questions' dispositions decide, so a banner above it would only repeat that
line out of order.
That is why the list above names no round record.

---

## Phase 8 — Resolve the defects the review settled

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §4 fixes exactly four resolutions a
`brd/brd-defect-log.md` entry can carry. **This command writes three of them, and only those:**

| Resolution | Written when |
|---|---|
| `customer-amended <SLICE-KEY> <date>` | the review supplies corrected text for the requirement the defect was raised against. `<SLICE-KEY>` is this run's own slice, whose returned review holds the text, and the `<date>` is the **review's**, not this run's — the amendment is the customer's act |
| `withdrawn` | the customer withdrew the requirement the defect was raised against — every `open` defect raised against it, whether or not the withdrawing `[CD#n]`'s `settles` names it: a requirement no longer asked for leaves nothing for its defect to be about |
| `resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]` | a `[CD#n]` this run froze, or completed from `open`, `settles` the defect, and neither row above applies — the customer said which reading they meant. The `[CD#n]` named is the one whose `settles` names the defect, never one that merely looks related, and `<SLICE-KEY>` is this run's own slice |

**`resolved-by` and `customer-amended` are always written qualified, with this slice's key** —
`resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]` and `customer-amended <SLICE-KEY> <date>`, the one spelling each
that `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §4 fixes. The log it is written into is the
parent's, which every slice under that parent resolves into, while each slice numbers its own
`[CD#n]` from 1 and keeps its own returned reviews: a bare `[CD#2]` there would name a decision in
whichever slice a reader guessed, and a bare date the review of whichever slice reconciled that day.
The key is the `<BRD-KEY>` this run resolved in Phase 0 — always a slice's, since a root is refused
there — never one read out of a folder name.

**Which of the three a settled defect takes is read off the answer, in this order:** `withdrawn`
where the `[CD#n]` drops the requirement the defect was raised against, obligation and all — the
*Update the coverage ledger* phase then writes `rejected: [DEF#n]`, which is how *"it was only a
sketch"* ends for an obligation only an image stated, and a row dropped while its obligation
survives in another is not this case (below); `customer-amended <SLICE-KEY> <date>` where the review
supplied corrected text for it; otherwise `resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]`. **A `[CD#n]` frozen
`open` resolves nothing**, and its defect stays open with it: one open for want of its reason keeps
its question held for the customer and its defect travels with that question (*Freeze the customer
decisions*, step 1), and one the will-change rule held open resolves its defect no sooner than the
sequence that closes the record — an answer not yet usable downstream settles nothing downstream.

**A requirement this ledger already reads `rejected: [DEF#n]` is not dropped by the answer.** The
delivery side dropped it, and `/product-workflows:brd-interview` put that rejection to the customer
in a question carrying its defect; a customer who answers it — accepting the rejection, or not — has
answered the question the defect raised, not withdrawn anything. The defect is
`resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]`, whichever rung of the order above the answer's wording would
otherwise reach — save a `conflict` or `duplicate` settled by keeping one row and dropping the other,
where the two rules meet (below) — and the row does not move. **Where the answer asks for it to be
built after all, no command reverses a `rejected` disposition**: no row of a slice's ledger returns
to `unallocated` (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3), and no `/brd-split` run moves a `rejected` row —
its walk takes only `unallocated` rows, and its sibling re-cut only a row a slice deferred
(`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3.2) — so no route is named. The row goes into the reconciliation
record's *what still needs a human*, with the customer's words quoted, for a person to take up with
them.

**A `conflict` or a `duplicate` settled by keeping one row and dropping the other** names two rows,
and only one of them lists the defect. **`withdrawn` — and the *Update the coverage ledger* phase's
`rejected: [DEF#n]` — is only for a requirement that is itself dropped**, so which applies turns on
what survives:

- a **`conflict`** whose **listed** row is dropped: that requirement is gone — `withdrawn`, and the
  row takes `rejected: [DEF#n]`;
- a **`duplicate`** whose two rows **restate** each other, whichever of them is dropped: the
  obligation survives in the row kept, so the defect is `resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]`, and the
  dropped row takes `superseded-by: [BR#kept]`, because a `[CD#n]` replaced it with the requirement
  kept;
- a **`conflict`** whose **counterpart** is dropped: the same two writes, and **not** for the same
  reason — a conflict's two rows are incompatible, so nothing of the dropped row survives in the one
  kept. What the `[CD#n]` did was choose between them, which is a resolution of the defect and a
  supersession of the row, and `superseded-by: [BR#kept]` records which row won rather than claiming
  the obligation moved. **Say which in the resolution's own text**: a reader who takes it for the
  duplicate case will look in the kept row for something that is not there;
- **Which of those two a `conflict` takes turns on a numbering fact, and that is worth knowing
  before it surprises someone**: the entry is listed on one of the two rows, the lowest-numbered of
  them (`brd-format.md` §3), and the branch above fires on whether *that* row or its counterpart is
  the one dropped. The outcome is substantive — the ledger's covered count falls by one either way,
  but only the listed-row branch takes `rejected: [DEF#n]` — while the input deciding it is which
  row happened to be numbered first at intake. Nothing here may re-list the entry to get the other
  branch: report the pair and the branch it took, so the operator sees the fact that decided it;
- a **`duplicate`** in which one row **is a part of** the other (`brd-format.md` §3), settled by
  keeping the part and dropping the whole: the defect is `resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]`, but no
  disposition says what became of the obligations the whole carried beyond the part —
  `superseded-by` would claim the part replaced them and `rejected` that the customer dropped them,
  and the answer may say neither. The ledger phase writes nothing for the dropped row, and it goes
  into the reconciliation record's *what still needs a human*, with the obligations the kept part
  does not cover named. Keeping the whole and dropping the part is treated as the bullet above
  treats a restatement: the whole covers the part, so the obligation survives in the row kept.

**Where the two rules meet — such a `conflict` or `duplicate`, one of whose rows this ledger already
reads `rejected` — this is their order, and it is stated once, here.** The `rejected` row never
moves: where the answer drops it, it already records that nobody builds it, and nothing is written
over it; where the answer keeps it, the customer wants it built after all, and it goes to *what still
needs a human* exactly as the paragraph on a row already reading `rejected` says. **The defect's
resolution and the other row's write follow the bullets above**, that paragraph notwithstanding: a
`conflict` whose listed row is the one dropped is `withdrawn`, and every other case is
`resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]`; and the dropped row, where it is not the rejected one, takes what
its bullet gives it, the rejected row kept beside it still reading `rejected` until a person acts on
the customer's words.

**That ledger write lands only where the dropped row is a row of this BRD's own ledger.** Where a
sibling slice holds it, it stays `covered-here` there; where the root holds it, never delegated, it
stays as the root's ledger records it. The ledger phase writes nothing in either — this command never
writes into another BRD's ledger — and the row, with the BRD that holds it, goes into the
reconciliation record's *what still needs a human* and the final report, so the owner settles it on
its own record.

`resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CG#n]` is a grounding outcome and this command produces no finding, so it
is never written here. `open` is the state a defect is already in and is never written *back* over a
resolution — a resolution recorded is not un-recorded by a later reading of it.

**The amendment stays in the returned review it came from — this slice's, as the resolution's key
says — and is never written into `brd/source/`** (D11, `brd-format.md` §4). A resolution changes the
log entry's status only: it never touches the source, and it never assigns the requirement a
disposition — the disposition vocabulary belongs to the coverage ledger, which the next phase
updates.

**On a slice, these rows land in the parent's log — and that is a cross-BRD write.** A slice holds no
`brd/brd-defect-log.md` of its own and inherits its parent's (`brd-format.md` §2.1), and that lookup
is **exactly one hop** because nesting is capped at one level — a slice's parent always owns the
source document and the log. The parent's log therefore joins this run's `deliverable_paths`, and the
reconciliation record names it by path so nobody looks for a resolution in the folder the command was
pointed at.

Because the log belongs to another BRD, **the cross-BRD write guard applies here in full**: run
`require-on-main` against the parent's `brd/brd-defect-log.md` first, and on any stopping row record
the resolutions rather than writing them, naming the parent's branch/PR state. A parent whose defect
log is mid-review is a parent somebody is editing, and a resolution written over it is a defect
classification lost without trace.

---

## Phase 9 — Update the coverage ledger

**A returned review never sets a disposition** (`customer-review-schema.md` §5 — the review does not
set the delivery team's coverage bookkeeping). What moves a row here is a **frozen `[CD#n]`**, and
this phase is the translation between the two.

**Three of the six dispositions are available to this command**
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §3):

| Disposition | Written when |
|---|---|
| `deferred-to: <this BRD>` | a `[CD#n]` defers the requirement — a live obligation, not built now |
| `rejected: [DEF#n]` | a `[CD#n]` withdrew it, citing the defect-log entry the previous phase resolved `withdrawn` |
| `rejected: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]` | a `[CD#n]` withdrew it and the previous phase resolved no entry `withdrawn` for it — no defect still `open` was raised on the requirement, since the previous phase resolves every such one `withdrawn` whatever the answer's `settles` names — citing that decision, qualified by this slice's key exactly as `resolved-by` is (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3) |
| `superseded-by: [BR#n]` | a `[CD#n]` replaced it with another requirement — a `[BR#n]` of the parent's inventory, which this slice need not claim or hold a row for, so a sibling slice's row qualifies (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3) |

**A row this ledger already reads `rejected` is never rewritten here**, whatever the answer: the
*Resolve the defects the review settled* phase says why, and what happens to it instead, where its
two rules meet.

**`covered-here` and `covered-by` are not.** Allocation — which BRD builds a requirement — is
`/brd-split`'s walk and nothing else's (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §4), and a customer decision is
not a statement about which BRD in the delivery organisation owns the work. **A row this run would
otherwise want to allocate is named in the reconciliation record's *what still needs a human*, with
the customer's words — and no command is named for it where it already carries a fate**: `/brd-split`
on this slice walks only `unallocated` rows, and a row `rejected`, `deferred-to` or `superseded-by` is
not one, so naming it would send the operator to a run that moves nothing. Its sibling re-cut, which
runs on the parent, re-points only a row a slice deferred, onto a sibling not yet interviewed, on an
instruction the operator gives (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3.2) — a person's call, which is why the
record names the row for a human rather than a command. Only a row still `unallocated` is
named with `/product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY>`: a slice this route interviewed never holds one,
since `/brd-interview` refuses an unallocated ledger, but a `--sent` review of a slice never
interviewed can find one, and that run is the one that walks it.
And **no row of this ledger ever returns to `unallocated`**: that is the initial state, moving a row
back into it would reopen a gate that has already been satisfied and cannot be re-satisfied by
anything this command does, and the one command that reopens rows, a `/brd-intake` re-run, writes a
source-owning BRD's ledger and never a slice's (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3).

**A requirement the customer asked for that no `[BR#n]` covers is not minted here.** The review's
section 4 is about intent, and a requirement the package missed entirely is its highest-value row —
but the inventory is extracted from an immutable source by `/brd-intake`, and a `[BR#n]` this
command invented would be a requirement with no anchor into the document the customer actually
signed. It is recorded in *what still needs a human*, naming the one route a command takes: a
revised source document from the customer, intaken over the root with
`/product-workflows:brd-intake <PARENT-KEY> @<revised-file>`, whose read extracts the requirement as
a new `[BR#n]` — a re-run that, where its read finds a requirement, puts every row of the root's
ledger back to `unallocated`, which its Phase 0 step 7 names before anything is copied. Short of
that, a person takes it up with the customer. No command logs an amendment for it:
`customer-amended` resolves a defect raised on a `[BR#n]` the inventory already holds
(`brd-format.md` §4), and this requirement has none.

**A withdrawal answering no question the package put moves nothing.** A row moves here only on a
frozen `[CD#n]`, and an answer matching no question is never frozen (*Confirm every candidate*):
a requirement the review marks `withdrawn` in its section 4 alone, or in a section-7 row answering
nothing the package asked, carries no decision the delivery side put to the customer. Name the
requirement in *what still needs a human*, with the customer's words, and name no command — the
person who takes it up decides whether a later interview round puts the question. A withdrawal
answering a question the package did put about the requirement — a requirement defect's, an
assumption's, or any other held `[C]` question's — is a section-7 answer like any other, frozen as a
`[CD#n]`, and moves the row by the table above.

**The roll-up, and what this phase must not do with it** (D23, `coverage-ledger-format.md` §6.1).
The ledger line resolves every `covered-by: <BRD-KEY>` row **one hop** through the named BRD's
own ledger — this run always stands on a slice (on the ordinary path, step 6 already confirmed a
`customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md` is on main, and that file is created only by
`/brd-package`, which itself refuses to run on a root — this command later banners it, and refuses a
root too), so that is always
the named sibling or parent (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3) — and every term in it is a *resolved*
count rather than a census of what the file says.
Two consequences bind this phase:

- **Decisions about this ledger read the dispositions written in this file, never the line.** The
  line's `unallocated` term does not track the allocation gate — a fully-allocated parent routinely
  reports a non-zero term for rows a child has not walked yet — so a phase that keyed anything off
  it would act on another BRD's unfinished walk.
- **This command never writes into another BRD's ledger**, one hop down or one across. A
  `covered-by` row whose obligation the customer has just withdrawn is a fact about the row in
  *this* file; what the BRD it names does about it belongs to that BRD's own reconciliation, and the
  propagation sweep is what names it there. Reaching one
  hop down to write would make the parent's line report a fate the child never recorded, which is
  the failure the roll-up exists to surface rather than a shortcut past it.

## Phase 10 — The propagation sweep

**Fix the changed-id set first, once, and sweep for nothing until it is fixed.** It is: every
`[CD#n]` frozen, completed from `open`, re-decided in place, reopened or superseded this run
(*Freeze the customer decisions*: its mint rule, and its step 3); every `[VD#n]` this
run reopened or superseded; every `[AS#n]` superseded; every `[SR#n]`
answered; every `[BR#n]` whose ledger row moved; and every `[DEF#n]` that gained a resolution. A set
that grows while the sweep runs makes the sweep's own coverage unknowable — some items were checked
against three ids and some against six, and afterwards nobody can say which.

**Every later reader takes this set as this step fixed it, and they are not all in this phase.**
The citation pass below matches items against it, id by id; the rule fixing **which fields of a
record that pass reads** tests each field's id class against it; the *stale cross-reference sweep*
searches every id in it as text, whitespace-tolerantly, across every markdown file under the parent;
and the *reconciliation record* records it as fixed. A class leaving this set narrows what is read
as surely as it narrows what is matched. That is why each of them reads this paragraph rather than
restating its contents. **One further site asserts a fact about this set without reading it**, and
it is named here because a narrowing leaves it stale rather than merely narrower: the stale
cross-reference sweep's `decisions.md` row justifies covering `settles` by saying `[DEF#n]` is a
class this set carries. Drop that class and the row still covers the field, correctly, on a reason
that has stopped being true. **Why no count is kept here**: the readers are named by what they do,
because a census is what an editor checks against and is the half of this paragraph that went
wrong — a sentence saying *twice* while three phases read the set would have sent that editor away
satisfied, with a dropped class left unsearched.

**The swept set has two sources, and only one of them is a scan.**

1. **Declared dependents — a scan.** Any BRD whose `brd-link.md` declares `depends-on:` carrying
   this run's `<BRD-KEY>`. Only a slice declares it — `/product-workflows:prd-ground` and
   `/product-workflows:brd-package` merge `depends-on:` into a slice's `brd-link.md`, as this
   command's *Apply the required corrections* phase does for a row asking to add one, and all three
   refuse a root — but the key it names may sit at any level (D17), so a slice depending on a
   source-owning BRD and a slice depending on a sibling are both found by the same scan, which still
   searches the three levels below `specifications/` that `workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds —
   the same bound `resolve-address` uses and for the same reason (`workflows-core:addressing` §3,
   §6) — because a hand-edited or pre-D5 root `brd-link.md` may carry one. This is the reverse of
   key resolution: a dependency is declared by the dependent, and nothing in this BRD's own folder
   lists who depends on it.
2. **BRDs this ledger delegates to — a lookup, not a scan.** Every distinct `<OTHER-KEY>` named by a
   `covered-by` row of `<BRD-dir>/coverage-ledger.md`, resolved with `resolve-address`. No scan is needed
   because this relation *is* listed in this BRD's own folder — which is exactly why it was missed:
   the paragraph above defines a dependent as something that declares itself, and a child is
   carved with `parent:` and `claims:` and no `depends-on:` naming the BRD it was carved from.

**The second source is what makes the *Update the coverage ledger* phase's promise true.** That
phase writes a `[CD#n]`-driven `deferred-to`, `rejected` or `superseded-by` onto rows of **this**
ledger, refuses to reach one hop down to write, and says "what the BRD it names does about it belongs
to that BRD's own reconciliation, and the propagation sweep is what names it there." Reached only by
the declared-dependents scan, that sentence named a mechanism that could not arrive: a customer
withdrawing a requirement this BRD had delegated left the owning BRD still grounding it, still
interviewing it and still packaging it, with nothing anywhere saying the obligation was gone. Where
this run moved a `covered-by` row's disposition, that row's owning BRD is in the set **on that
account alone**, whether or not anything in it cites a changed id.

The cross-BRD write guard applies to both sources identically, and nothing about the second widens
what may be written: a delegated row's fate in the owning BRD is still that BRD's to record, so what
this sweep produces there is a disposition against its **register**, never a write into its ledger.

**`conditional_on` positions are swept first, and they are swept whether or not they cite a changed
id.** Every `[VD#n]`, `[CD#n]` and `[AS#n]` in a dependent BRD carrying
`conditional_on: <this BRD-KEY>/<decision-id>` is the sweep's opening pass. **That is what the field
is for** (`decision-register-format.md` §5): a position built on a prerequisite is not wrong, it is
*invisible* — nothing in its own text says it should be re-examined when the prerequisite moves — and
`conditional_on` is what makes it reachable mechanically instead of by somebody remembering.

The order is load-bearing rather than tidy. The `conditional_on` pass is the **complete** one: it
finds every position that declared its dependency, exhaustively, by a field. The citation pass that
follows is the **incomplete** one: it finds positions that happen to name a changed id in text. A
sweep that ran the incomplete pass first and then "also checked" `conditional_on` has made the
mechanical, complete pass an afterthought to the textual one, and the first time the two disagree the
afterthought is what gets skipped.

**Then the citation pass:** every decision and every `[AS#n]` in every dependent BRD naming an id
in the changed set, plus every finding those decisions rest on. **Which fields are read is derived
from `decision-register-format.md` §1 rather than kept as a list here**, because a list written
here goes stale against §1 the first time a field is added, and the field it omits is the one
nobody notices. **Read every field §1 defines. Skip exactly two kinds and read the rest:**

- a field whose value §1 **fixes to an identifier class** — on every record kind the field appears
  on, §7's assumption rows included — **where the changed set carries no id of that class**. A
  field §7 gives a different meaning on an `[AS#n]` is not fixed, and is read.
- a field that **names the record itself** rather than citing another.

**The skip list is the short one on purpose, and the default is to read.** This pass fails by
missing a citation, never by reading a field that turns out to hold none — scanning a fixed
vocabulary or a round number costs nothing and finds nothing — so a field added to §1 tomorrow is
read on the day it is added, without a reader having to notice it. A rule shaped the other way
round, enumerating what to read, has to be *maintained* into correctness every time §1 moves, and
this paragraph has now been wrong in both directions for exactly that reason: it once over-produced
and struck `defects` out by hand, then under-produced and let an `[AS#n]`'s `evidence` in only by a
worked reading.

*Read against §1 and the set this phase fixed, the two fields skipped today are `defects` and
`id`, and everything else is read* — a reading of the rule above, not a second copy of it.
`defects` holds `[CDF#n]` ids on every record kind (§1, §7's *As-is*) and the set carries no
`[CDF#n]`, a code defect being the operator's to re-dispose in an interview round rather than a
customer's to change; the day that set admits one, this pass reads `defects` with nothing here
changing. `id` names the record, and a bare id there would resolve against the dependent's own
register in any case.
`evidence` is read because §7 makes it the why-no-evidence **statement** on an `[AS#n]` — prose
that can name a changed id in a sentence — so §1 does not fix it on every record kind it appears
on, whatever it fixes on the two decision kinds. `settles` is read on the class test alone: it
holds the `[DEF#n]` the set carries for every defect that gained a resolution.

**`chosen` is read on both record kinds, and for the same reason `statement` is.** On a `[CD#n]` it
can be the customer's answer quoted verbatim, where they answered outside the options put (§1) —
which is exactly where a changed id gets named in words nobody may edit. On a `[VD#n]` it is the
option the operator chose, in the delivery team's own words. `options_considered` is read with it
because a `chosen` that is not the outside-the-options form **is** one of its members, so reading
one without the other would find an id in the answer and miss the same id in the option beside it.
**A hit in either is disposed like any other, and no disposition corrects the text**:
`inherited-unchanged` writes nothing into the dependent's record, `reopened` and `withdrawn` move
`status` and append their closing paragraph, and `reverted` restores the whole position under §4
rather than editing a sentence inside one. Correcting a stale sentence is the *other* sweep's act,
and its `decisions.md` row refuses it there.

**Every item the sweep reaches is forced to exactly one disposition.** Present each one at a time,
with the item and **what reached it**, which is not the same fact on both passes. An item the
citation pass found is presented with the changed id it names and what changed about that id. A
`conditional_on` position was reached **by the field**, which is what that pass is for, so it is
presented with the prerequisite decision the field names and whether this run moved it — **which
the run already knows**: the citation pass reads `conditional_on` among its fields, so *did this run
move the prerequisite* and *did that pass match this item on that field* are one question, and the
answer comes from that match rather than from testing the set again, which would make this step a
reader of the set and the list at *Fix the changed-id set first* incomplete. Where it did not move
it, say so in as many words rather than leaving the line blank: a position resting on a decision
this run left alone is exactly the one an operator can dispose in a sentence, and an empty
"what changed" reads as a run that failed to work it out:

```
choices: ["Inherited unchanged — the change does not move this position; say why", "Reverted — the position returns to what it stood at before the prerequisite moved it", "Reopened — this must be decided again; status: reopened, naming this cause", "Withdrawn — the question this answered has stopped applying"]
```

**Not an escalation array either**: the four options are the four dispositions the design fixes for
this sweep, in that order, and a fifth would be a disposition nothing downstream can read — which is
why `workflows-core:escalation-rules`'s *Closed-vocabulary pickers must normalise the free-text answer* section names this
picker among the arrays whose free-text answer must be normalised into their own vocabulary rather than
written through. No `(Recommended)`
marker, and the reason is stated beside the list per the
`When no option is safe to recommend` guidance in `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "escalation-rules")`: which one is right is a
judgement about a position in another BRD, taken by whoever owns it, and a marker would invite the
run to inherit-unchanged its way through a sweep whose whole purpose is to find what did move.

***Reopened* and *Reverted* are unavailable on some items, and there the array is presented
without whichever of them is unavailable — one, or both; on a terminal record every writing disposition is, and the item is not presented (the
last bullet).** That is a narrowing of what a record can be written to, not a fifth disposition: dropping
an option leaves two or three, which the harness renders, where a fifth could not be rendered at all
(`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0). Nothing else about the array changes — the survivors keep
their order and their wording, and an item still takes exactly one.

- **On an `[AS#n]` item, *Reopened* is not available.** `decision-register-format.md` §7 narrows an
  assumption's status vocabulary to `open`, `superseded` and `withdrawn`: `decided` cannot apply to
  an assertion nobody chose, and `reopened` follows `decided`, so it is unreachable. Writing it
  anyway drops the assumption out of every set that reads `open` — `/product-workflows:brd-package`
  carries **open** `[AS#n]`s into its prompt's *decisions the customer must make* and *where to
  attack us hardest* parts and counts them in its something-to-review gate — so the assumption
  silently stops being shown to the customer, which is the failure the assumption record exists to
  prevent. An assumption the change makes untenable takes **Withdrawn**; one that merely has to be
  re-taken is already `open` and is put to the customer again in the next package on that account
  alone, so it takes **Inherited unchanged** with the sweep row saying that is what carries it.
  `superseded` is in no item's array: an `[AS#n]` reaches it only through a `[CD#n]` confirming it,
  in *Freeze the customer decisions*.
- **On any `[VD#n]` or `[CD#n]` item whose `status` is not `decided`, *Reopened* is not
  available.** `reopened` follows `decided` (`decision-register-format.md` §3), so a record held
  `open` — for want of its reason, or by the will-change rule — cannot take it, nor can one already
  `reopened`, `superseded` or `withdrawn`. Where this run's change is something the record must now
  be decided against, it is the item the paragraph below names.
- **On any item whose prior position the record does not preserve, *Reverted* is not available** —
  the `reverted` row below says where that position is read from and what it cannot recover — **nor
  on one whose restored `evidence` the will-change rule fires on** where the restored position
  carries none of that rule's resolutions, which the same row states.
- **An item whose record is `superseded` or `withdrawn` is not presented at all.** Both are terminal
  (`decision-register-format.md` §3), so none of the three writing dispositions can be written into
  it, and a one-option array is not one the harness renders (`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0).
  Its sweep row is written `inherited-unchanged`, the reason being that the record is terminal and
  nothing reaches it — and where this run's change would have moved the position had it still stood,
  the item is named in *what still needs a human* as below.

Where the disposition an item would otherwise have taken is one the array dropped, the item still takes
one of the survivors **and** is named in the reconciliation record's *what still needs a human*,
with the dependent's record, the changed id or prerequisite that reached it, and what the register
cannot carry — so the judgement reaches somebody who can take it, rather than being written as a
value no reader downstream can act on or left out of the sweep's own account.

| Disposition | Recorded as |
|---|---|
| `inherited-unchanged` | **nothing is written into the dependent's record**, which is unchanged; the row is this run's, in the reconciliation record (*Write the reconciliation record*, *The sweeps*), naming the dependent's record and what was considered against it — the changed id, or, for a `conditional_on` position this run's changes never reached, the prerequisite decision its field names and the fact that this run did not move it — each qualified (below), and why the position does not move. **That case takes this disposition and no other**, and by the other three rows' own definitions rather than by a rule here: each of them records a cause that *is* a changed id — the prerequisite's move, §4's incoming customer decision, the withdrawal's driver — so an item the field alone reached, with nothing of this run's inside it, has no cause to write into them. **The row is written even so** — an item checked and found unaffected and an item never reached are different facts |
| `reverted` | the record returns to the position that stood before the prerequisite moved it, **each of its fields under the rule `decision-register-format.md` §4 gives that field** — the seven a decision's own writing fills restored (on an `[AS#n]`, only those of them §7 admits), `consumed_by` back to `none`, `round` the restored position's, `altitude`, `id` and `settles` standing — and the changed id, qualified (below), is named in a closing `Reverted <YYYYMMDD>:` paragraph appended to its `argumentation`, beneath everything that field already holds, which this write never rewrites (§4). **Where the position being restored is read from, and what a reversion therefore cannot recover, is §4's rule and is not re-derived here.** Where the record does not establish what a restored field's value was, this disposition is **not available** for that item: say so where the array is presented, take one of the survivors, and name the item in *what still needs a human* with the prerequisite, the field and what the record does not say. A record whose reversion the run cannot write is not a record it may mark `reverted`, and a field it cannot recover is never invented and never left half-written. **§4 writes `evidence` and `conditional_on` under §6's will-change rule, and a reversion is one of those writes**: test the restored `evidence` by the test the *Freeze the customer decisions* phase applies, read off the dependent's own grounding files. Where it fires and the restored position does not already carry one of §6's resolutions — a `conditional_on` naming the prerequisite decision, or `status: open` — `reverted` is **not available** for that item either: a reversion restores a position and decides nothing, so it cannot choose a resolution on the dependent's behalf. Say so where the array is presented, take one of the survivors, and name the item in *what still needs a human* with the findings the rule fired on |
| `reopened` | `status: reopened` on that record, its cause — this run's `[CD#n]`, qualified (below) — named in the closing `Reopened <YYYYMMDD>:` paragraph `decision-register-format.md` §4 appends to its `argumentation`: an incoming customer decision is exactly one of the two causes §4 admits |
| `withdrawn` | `status: withdrawn`, its reason — naming the changed id, qualified (below) — in a closing `Withdrawn <YYYYMMDD>:` paragraph appended to its `argumentation` (`decision-register-format.md` §4): the question stopped applying rather than being answered differently. It is **not** a tidier spelling of `superseded` (§3), and it is what stops a request from reappearing in the next customer package after the customer has already dealt with it |

**Every id a sweep write names carries the key of the BRD whose numbering it is**, because the write
lands in a dependent's register, which numbers its own records: a bare `[CD#3]` there resolves
against the dependent's own register — to the wrong record where that register holds a `[CD#3]`,
and to nothing where it does not — and that register ships in the dependent's own package, whose
citation check resolves a bare id the same way (`bundle-packaging.md` §6.2's relation 1). The key
is this run's own `<BRD-KEY>` for a `[CD#n]`, `[VD#n]`, `[AS#n]` or `[SR#n]`, each numbered in this
slice's own register or self-review, and `<PARENT-KEY>` for a `[BR#n]` or `[DEF#n]`, which are the
parent's ids on a slice (`brd-format.md` §2.1). **Every such id is written in prose, in the one
qualified spelling `bundle-packaging.md` §6.2 fixes, `<BRD-KEY> [CD#n]`, and the table above names
where each write puts it**: the closing `Reverted`, `Reopened` or `Withdrawn` paragraph of the
dependent record's `argumentation` (`decision-register-format.md` §4), and, for an
`inherited-unchanged` item, which writes nothing into the record, the sweep row of this run's
reconciliation record, where the dependent's own record is named with the dependent's key the same
way. **Never the cross-BRD slash shape `decision-register-format.md` §5 fixes, `<BRD-KEY>/[CD#n]`**:
that is the spelling of a structured field an authority declares — `conditional_on` among them — and
§6.2's relation 1 reads it as qualified only in a field its table lists. No sweep write names a
changed id in one of those fields: the one of a record's thirteen (`decision-register-format.md`
§1) that takes the ids this rule is about is `argumentation`, which is prose, and a `reverted`
write that restores `conditional_on` restores the value the record already held, in that field's
own shape (§4).

**A dependent BRD whose register is in flight is recorded, never written.** This is the *cross-BRD
write guard* above, applied to each dependent's `decisions.md`: `require-on-main` first, and on any
stopping row the dependent is named in the reconciliation record and in the final report with its
concrete branch/PR state and the dispositions this run would have written, with **nothing written
into it**. It is never a stop of the whole run, for the reason that section gives.

**Findings are named, not superseded.** A `[CG#n]` or `[DG#n]` carrying `horizon: will-change` whose
named prerequisite decision this run has just frozen is exactly the shape the horizon exists to make
visible (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §5) — but a `will-change` finding is never deleted and is superseded
only by a *later finding at a later commit*, which only a `/prd-ground` run produces. Every one the
sweep reaches is recorded with the concrete fix — `/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> --rebaseline`
— and carried into *what still needs a human*. A finding this command marked `SUPERSEDED` would be a
supersession with nothing on the other side of it.

**A re-run re-sweeps what was recorded and not written, and only that.** An item an earlier pass
over this same review **disposed and wrote** is skipped and reported as already swept. A dependent
BRD that pass could only **record** — its register was in flight — is swept again in full, because
nothing was ever written into it. Collapsing the two would make the recorded-not-written state
permanent: the operator merges the dependent's pull request exactly so the sweep can land, and a
re-run that skipped it would silently refuse to.

**The gate.** Any swept item still undisposed when this phase would end → stop:
`BRD_RECONCILE_UNSWEPT: N positions in dependent BRDs are still undisposed — every one takes inherited-unchanged | reverted | reopened | withdrawn.`

---

## Phase 11 — The stale cross-reference sweep

**The sweep is not optional, and it is not a grep.** Its root is the **parent's** folder — and that
root bounds everything here except search 1's literal-id pass, which also reads the previous phase's
already-resolved dependent set (below). The root is the
source-owning BRD's directory and every slice inside it — so that a *sibling* slice still asserting a
superseded position is reached. Every markdown file under it is in scope:
the seeds, `slices.md`, the inventory, the figures file, the ledger, the grounding files, every
register, the code-defect log, every round record, every dated snapshot, every effort proposal and
its brief with their archived revisions — a slice's and the umbrella's — and the customer's own
captured files.

**Two searches, and the second is the one that matters.**

1. **The changed ids, literally.** Every id in the set the previous phase fixed, searched as text,
   **whitespace-tolerantly** — an identifier is routinely broken across a line wrap in prose, and a
   search that only matched it on one line would report a clean tree over an artifact that names it
   twice.

   **This first search alone also runs over the previous phase's swept set**, wherever a BRD in it
   falls outside this root — the declared dependents that scan found anywhere under `specifications/`,
   and the BRDs this ledger delegates to. No new traversal: that set is already resolved, and this
   reads the same files in it. **The second search does not follow**, deliberately: it cannot be
   reduced to a pattern and needs a reader who knows what the old position claimed, which is
   affordable over one parent's folder and is not over the whole tree.

   **What this reaches that nothing else did is the dependent's `code-defect-log.md`.** A `[CDF#n]`
   declares its dependency by a field — `blocked_on: <BRD-KEY>/<decision-id>`
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-defect-log-format.md` §5) — exactly as a decision declares
   one with `conditional_on`, but the previous phase's citation pass walks decisions and `[AS#n]`
   only, and this sweep's root stops at the parent. Inside the parent the log was always swept and a
   hit always took `needs-a-human`; outside it, a defect blocked on a decision that has just moved was
   reached by neither. **The outcome is unchanged and no new one is added**: the row below sends every
   `code-defect-log.md` hit to `needs-a-human`, because every disposition on that log is the operator's
   and `/product-workflows:brd-interview` is its only writer. What travels is the finding, not a
   correction.

   **Outside this root the only outcomes available are `still-true` and `needs-a-human`; `updated` is
   not.** This widening is detection, and the write surface does not move with it: correcting a
   sentence in an arbitrary dependent's prose is a wider write path than anything here has argued for,
   and it is not bought by reaching that file to look at it. So the guard table's *stale
   cross-reference sweep* row stays true exactly as written — `updated` corrections still go only into
   artifacts under the parent.

   **Why `blocked_on` belongs here and a `will-change` finding's `prerequisite` does not**, which is
   the distinction to hold if this is ever widened again: a finding's `prerequisite` moving does not
   make the finding untrue — it stays a true record of its pinned commit and is superseded by a later
   finding at a later commit (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §5), so there is nothing for a sweep to
   reopen. A `[CDF#n]`'s `blocked_on` moving does not make the defect untrue either — but it moves the
   **disposition**, which is a position, and reopening positions whose ground has shifted is what these
   two sweeps exist for.
2. **Prose asserting a now-superseded position, with no id in it at all.** For each position this run
   changed, search for the *claim the old position made*, in the words these artifacts use for it,
   and read every hit. This half cannot be reduced to a pattern, and skipping it is what the sweep
   exists to prevent: **updating a register while a value document still states the old position is
   the characteristic failure of this step.** The register is the only place anybody looks to check
   a decision, so the contradiction is invisible from there — and the package ends up internally
   contradicting itself in front of the customer who caused the change, which is the worst possible
   audience for it.

**Each hit takes one of three outcomes**, and every hit gets one:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `updated` | the sentence is corrected, naming the `[CD#n]` that changed it. **Where the artifact belongs to another BRD** — the parent's own, or a sibling slice's — it names it `<BRD-KEY> [CD#n]`, for the reason the propagation sweep's qualification gives, and the *cross-BRD write guard* applies: `require-on-main` first, and on a stopping row the hit becomes `needs-a-human` naming that state, never `updated` |
| `still-true` | the sentence survives the change; **why** it survives is recorded, because "I looked and it was fine" and "I did not look" leave the same trace otherwise |
| `needs-a-human` | the correction is a judgement this run cannot take, or the hit is inside a dated snapshot; it travels into *what still needs a human* |

**The guard is why this sweep's writing root being the parent's folder is safe** — and *writing* is
the word that carries it, since search 1 above reads wider than that. Reaching a sibling slice is
the whole point of rooting it there — a superseded position asserted in a sibling's seed is invisible
from this BRD's own folder — but reaching it and *writing* into it are two different acts, and the
second is a cross-BRD write like any other. Without the guard this sweep would be the widest
unguarded write path in the command: it touches every markdown file under the parent, most of which
belong to some other BRD.

**A hit inside a dated snapshot is never edited.** It is bannered by the *Banner the superseded dated
snapshots* phase where that phase's rules reach it, and inside `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/` it is neither
edited nor bannered — it is recorded, for the byte-identical reason that phase gives.

**Nor is a hit ever `updated` inside a structured record, in an effort proposal, or anywhere in the
customer's own captured files.** The scope above is deliberately every markdown file under the
parent, which is what reaches a sibling's seed — but much of what it reaches carries content another
rule already fixes, and `updated` on any of it would contradict that rule rather than correct a
stale sentence.

**The test is the class, not the filename, and the table below is worked cases rather than the
list.** A hit is `needs-a-human` wherever it lands in **a structured record** — any file whose
content is fields, rows or labelled lines some other rule writes and reads — **in a document that
changes only by a revision of its own**, which is what an effort proposal and its brief are — **or
in anything the customer wrote**, captured or quoted. The rows below work the kinds a run meets most
often; they do not bound the rule, and a file kind absent from them is not thereby correctable. A
run that reached for the list found five more that belong to it on the class test alone —
`brd/brd-defect-log.md`, `brd-link.md`, `interview/customer-questions.md`, a returned
`customer-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` and `brd/brd-link-log.md` — and had the table been the rule,
`updated` would have been available on every one of them:

| Where the hit landed | Outcome, and the rule that decides it |
|---|---|
| a `coverage-ledger.md` `disposition` — **any** ledger's, this BRD's included | `needs-a-human`. Allocation is `/product-workflows:brd-split`'s walk and nothing else's, and the *Update the coverage ledger* phase writes only the three `[CD#n]`-driven dispositions onto **this** ledger and never reaches one hop down or across (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3, §4) |
| a `brd/brd-inventory.md` row's `id`, `text` or `source_anchor` | `needs-a-human`. `text` is the requirement verbatim from an immutable source and `source_anchor` locates it there; an id is assigned once and never renumbered (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1, §2). A sweep that reflowed one would edit the record of what the customer actually wrote |
| any field of a `decisions.md` record — the complete set `decision-register-format.md` §4 names, **`argumentation` alone excepted** | `needs-a-human` unless it is this run's own propagation-sweep write. They move only through this command's own freeze, the four dispositions the previous phase fixes, or §4's two reopening causes — and `consumed_by` through the stamp an authoring command writes on a record it drew on — never because a sentence nearby went stale. The set is cited rather than listed so a field §4 adds is covered on the day it is added, and so `settles` — the one structured field holding a `[DEF#n]`, which is an id this sweep's changed set carries — is covered rather than falling to the prose fallback below. The exception is `argumentation` alone: it is the route's own prose, which is what `updated` is for (below). **`chosen` is the case that shows this row is about the field and not about whose words it holds**: on a `[CD#n]` it can be the customer's answer quoted verbatim, immutable under `bundle-packaging.md` §6.3 and never edited here; on a `[VD#n]` it is the delivery team's own text, so that argument does not bind — and the outcome is the same, because what freezes a `chosen` is the decision it records, not its authorship. The propagation sweep's citation pass reads it on both, which is what makes a hit there reported rather than silently missed |
| a `code-defect-log.md` entry — **any field of it, its `statement` and `intent` prose included** | `needs-a-human`. Every disposition on that log is the operator's and `/product-workflows:brd-interview` is its only writer (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-defect-log-format.md` §4), so there is no field of a `[CDF#n]` this sweep may write — which is why this row, like every row below it, covers prose too |
| a `brd/brd-figures.md` section — **any line of it** | `needs-a-human`. Its transcription records what the customer's image shows, which no decision changes, and its *Read*, *Appearance*, hash, *Linked from* and *Rows* lines are `/product-workflows:brd-intake`'s to write (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1.2). A correction to a transcription arrives only as a section-12 row, which the *Apply the required corrections* phase disposes of; a hit here means the customer's own picture still shows a position the answer moved, which is for a person to take up with them |
| any file under `brd/source/` or `brd/source-external/` — the customer's document and every file captured with it, **any line of it** | `needs-a-human`, and the file is **never touched at all** — the *Apply the required corrections* phase's class 3 (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1, §1.1). A stale position there is the customer's own wording; what the answer changed is recorded beside it, as a defect resolution or in *what still needs a human*, never as an edit in it |
| a `proposal.md` or `proposal-brief.md` — a slice's or the umbrella's, **any line of it**, and every archived revision of either under `revisions/` | `needs-a-human`, and the file is **never edited**. A proposal moves only by a revision: the next run of the command that wrote it archives the prior revision and classifies every moved figure as a **re-estimate** and every withdrawn or contradicted statement as a **correction**, listed first and never netted into a total (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §2, §12). A sentence corrected in place changes what the customer may already have been sent, with neither the archive nor the classification to show it. Record the hit in *what still needs a human* with that run as its remedy — `/product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>` for a slice's proposal, `<SLICE-KEY>` being the slice whose folder holds it, and `/product-workflows:brd-proposal <PARENT-KEY>` for the umbrella in the parent's folder, the slice's first where both carry the hit, since the umbrella reads each slice's figures out of that slice's own `proposal.md` (§14 there). A hit only in an archived revision names no re-run: the revision is history, recorded as a hit in any dated snapshot is |

**What `updated` is for is the route's own prose**, and only that: a sentence in a seed, a rationale
in `slices.md`, an `argumentation` paragraph that still argues the old position. Those have no
other authority over them, which is why the correction is safe there and is refused everywhere above
— the customer's prose included, which is prose but not the route's, and a proposal's, which moves
only by a revision (above). A round record's prose is not
among them either: the record is a dated snapshot and append-only, so a hit in it is
`needs-a-human`, like a hit in any other dated snapshot.
**Saying so is not belt-and-braces.** The scope sentence names "the ledger" and "the inventory"
outright, and a reader working the outcome table against a hit in one of them has no reason to stop
— the guard on `updated` is `require-on-main`, which passes on a merged file and would license
exactly the write two other rules forbid.

## Phase 12 — Write the reconciliation record

Write `<BRD-dir>/reconciliation-<YYYYMMDD>.md`, stamped with **this run's** date. It says what
changed, why, which ids, and what still needs a human:

- **What the review was reconciled against** — a package `/brd-package` built and handed off, or,
  where `--sent` was given, operator-supplied sent material admitted under the *Resolve inputs and
  gate the sent package* phase. On the second, name every admitted path as it was supplied and as it
  was committed under `customer-sent-<YYYYMMDD>/`, and say plainly that this material was not
  assembled under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md`'s rules — a later reader
    weighing what a quotation was checkable against needs to know which of the two they are holding.
  Name the package the review answers by its date, how it was determined — the `Package reviewed`
  line, a date section 1 named, the only package on file, or the operator's pick — and the
  `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` its `[SR#n]` ids were resolved against, or say that it could not be
  determined and why — a later pass resolves
  an `[SR#n]` through this line and no other (*Confirm every candidate*).
- **The review** — the canonicalised copy by path, the original path it arrived on, the mode the
  reader worked in and what decided it, the verdict, the readiness statement **quoted verbatim** (it
  is one sentence long precisely so it can be quoted without being softened), the twelve sections'
  states, the evidence limitations as stated — or the plain fact that they were not stated — and
  every anomaly, unrepaired.
- **What changed** — every `[CD#n]` frozen, with its quotation, its status, what it answers — a
  `[C]` by round and position, an `[AS#n]`, or an `[SR#n]` with the self-review file named above —
  and how it was confirmed, and, where its `altitude` had nothing to copy, that this run decided
  it; every candidate rejected or sent back to the customer, with its reason; every candidate
  skipped as
  *already reconciled* by the same-review rule, with the record in its chain that pass wrote and,
  where it is no longer the live record, the successor or withdrawal since; every candidate recorded
  as *already reconciled, re-affirmed by* `<review file>`, with the live `[CD#n]` it re-affirms
  (*Confirm every candidate*); every candidate the operator
  re-pointed onto a question the package put, with the target the reader returned and the question
  named (*Confirm every candidate*); every `[AS#n]` superseded; every
  `[VD#n]` or `[CD#n]` reopened or superseded here; every `[CD#n]` re-decided in place, with the
  entry whose `- **Re-puts:**` line named it; every `[CD#n]` completed from `open`, with the reason
  the review supplied; every record *Freeze the customer decisions* step 3 left at its status, with
  the `[CD#n]` that contradicts or constrains it; every correction with its disposition; every banner added; every defect
  resolution, with the log's path; every ledger row moved.
- **The sweeps** — the changed-id set as fixed; per dependent BRD, every `conditional_on` position
  and every citing item with its disposition and reason, each id in the qualified prose form the
  propagation sweep fixes, and every dependent recorded-not-written
  with its state; per stale-reference hit, the file, what was found, and its outcome.
- **What still needs a human** — every `[SR#n]` answer carried `unmatched` because the package the
  review answers could not be determined (*Ingest the review*), with the customer's words; every
  question the review did not answer, in **all three** of the id shapes the package put to it, so
  an escalated `[SR#n]` the customer passed over is not lost
  behind the `[C]` questions that were; every candidate not frozen; every correction deferred or
  refused, a refused correction to an effort proposal with the proposal re-run the *Apply the
  required corrections* phase names as its fix; every code and design challenge, with `/prd-ground`
  as the fix; every `will-change` finding needing a rebaseline; every `[CD#n]` the will-change rule
  (*Freeze the customer decisions*) wrote conditional or held open, with its findings, the
  prerequisite decision or decisions they name, the resolution taken, and, for one held open, the
  sequence that rule names as what closes it — and, where it was held open because a finding's
  `prerequisite` does not carry its BRD key, that unqualified value quoted as it stands, with the
  finding carrying it; every record *Freeze the customer decisions* step 3 left at its status
  because it was not `decided`, with the `[CD#n]` that contradicts or constrains it; every
  candidate whose target's live record reads `withdrawn`, with the customer's words and that record,
  nothing frozen from it, and the held entry closed for it where there was one (*Confirm every
  candidate*); every record this run's answers reached more
  than once, with every `[CD#n]` that reached it; every candidate *Confirm every candidate* set
  aside as a conflicting answer, with the customer's words and the candidate frozen in its place,
  or that the one kept went back to the customer for its reason; every propagation-sweep item whose
  disposition the array dropped, with the dependent's record, the changed id or prerequisite that
  reached it, and what the register cannot carry — for a *Reverted* withheld, the field not
  recoverable or the findings the will-change rule fired on; every sweep item whose record is
  `superseded` or `withdrawn` where this run's change would have moved the position had it still
  stood, with the same three; every dependent recorded-not-written, with a re-run of
  `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile <BRD-KEY> @<review-file>` on this same review as the fix, once
  that dependent's register is on the default branch; every `needs-a-human` hit, in prose, in a
  structured record or in an effort proposal, the last with the proposal re-run the stale
  cross-reference sweep names as its fix; every requirement the customer asked for that no `[BR#n]`
  covers; and every row the customer dropped that another BRD holds (*Resolve the defects the
  review settled*), with that BRD named; and every `duplicate` settled by keeping the part, with
  the obligations the kept row does not cover named; and every inventory row drawn from an image
  whose quoted element an `applied` transcription correction changed, with the row and the
  corrected element named — any defect the row carries stays open for its own question; every
  answer matching no question the package put that the operator recorded for a human, a withdrawal
  among them, with the identifier its row names, where it names one, and the customer's words
  quoted (*Confirm every candidate*, *Update the coverage ledger*); every requirement the review
  marks `withdrawn` in its section 4 alone, with the customer's words (*Update the coverage
  ledger*); every row the customer asked to be built that is still `unallocated`, with
  `/product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY>` as the run that allocates it (*Update the coverage
  ledger*); and every row the customer asked to be built that already carries a fate, a `rejected`
  one after all among them, with the row and the customer's words, naming no command, because no
  run the record could name allocates it (*Update the coverage ledger*).

**A second reconciliation on the same day appends, and never overwrites.** Where
`reconciliation-<YYYYMMDD>.md` already exists, this run adds a new pass beneath what is there, under
its own heading naming the review file that caused it. Two reviews ingested on one day are two
events, and this file is the record of both — stopping instead would leave an operator holding a
second review with no way to process it until tomorrow.

---

## Phase 13 — Handoff

Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff")` and present its §4.3 choice array verbatim:

```
choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git (the next phase will stop until this is on main)", "Cancel"]
```

On the first choice, execute `handoff-to-main` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff handoff-to-main")`, §2) with `prefix: brd` (§2.9's
table), `feature_folder` as resolved in the *Resolve inputs and gate the sent package* phase,
`deliverable_paths` = the canonicalised review at its resolved name and, where `--sent` was given,
every file beneath `customer-sent-<YYYYMMDD>/`, one literal path each and never the directory (both
still listed, so a run whose first handoff was declined lands them here), `decisions.md`, `interview/round-<N>.md` and
`interview/customer-questions.md` where on file (a slice never interviewed holds neither, and a
`--sent` run admits one — Phase 0 step 2), `coverage-ledger.md`, the requirement defect log's path
(**the parent's**, on a slice — the slice-owned `code-defect-log.md` is written by nothing here),
every artifact the *Apply the required corrections* phase changed — a transcription correction on a
slice lands in the parent's `brd/brd-figures.md`, and a correction nobody declares here is a
correction that never reaches the default branch — every dated artifact this run bannered,
`reconciliation-<YYYYMMDD>.md`, every dependent BRD's `decisions.md` the sweep wrote, and every artifact the stale-reference sweep updated;
`title: <BRD-KEY> Reconcile the returned customer review <YYYYMMDD>`; and `body_facts` = what the
review was reconciled against (a handed-off package, or `--sent` material with its committed path);
the mode the
review was read in; the `[CD#n]` ids frozen and the count of candidates rejected or sent back; the
`[C]` questions closed and any still open; the corrections by disposition; the banners added; the
defect resolutions; the ledger rows moved; every dependent BRD swept, with its dispositions and any
recorded-not-written state; and the count of stale-reference hits by outcome. Emit its §4.1 outcome
line in the final report, beside the *Canonicalise the returned review* phase's.

This handoff **reuses the branch that phase created** (§2.2 rule 3), so both commits land on one
branch and one pull request — the customer's document first, then what was decided about it, in the
order they happened.

---

## Phase 14 — Next steps

This run leaves a **reconciled** BRD: customer decisions frozen, dependents swept, and every artifact
under the parent checked for a position the answer overturned. That is the state the BRD-to-PRD
route's exit was waiting for, and **all three BRD routes ship** — so this phase offers them,
each under the precondition the offered command actually enforces rather than under an assumed one:

**This run always stands on a slice** — on the ordinary path, step 6 already confirmed a
`customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md` is on main, and that file is created only by
`/brd-package`, which itself refuses to run on a root (this command later banners it, and refuses a
root too) — so there is no level branch
to take here, and none of the three commands' own container refusals
(`CREATE_PRD_BRD_NOT_SLICED`, `CREATE_ARD_BRD_NOT_SLICED`, `SPECIFY_BRD_NOT_SLICED`;
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5) can fire against the `<SLICE-KEY>`
this phase offers.

- **`/product-workflows:create-prd <SLICE-KEY>` is offered only where this slice is PRD-eligible** —
  two tests, both read off `coverage-ledger.md` as this run left it and both owned by
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5: **no** row of
  this slice's ledger is still `unallocated`, and **at least one** of them is `covered-here`.
  **The rows are this slice's ledger rows, narrowed by its `brd-link.md` `claims:`.** This
  is the same gate set `/product-workflows:create-prd`'s Phase 0 step 7 defines, read the same way — and
  the narrowing drops something real, without changing either verdict: a slice's
  ledger may hold **orphan rows** — ledger rows for `[BR#n]`s it no longer claims, whose claim `/brd-split`'s walk on the parent withdrew and wrote to a terminal disposition, or left at the one this slice's own walk had written, whether that claim was still provisional or was one this slice had committed to and then recorded it would not build, which a re-cut then moved to a sibling (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §2, §3, §3.2). `claims:` names none of them, so the gate set never reaches one — which matters, because an orphan row left standing as the slice's own earlier decision can read `covered-here` (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §2), and read outside the gate set it would add
  the option.
  These two tests are exactly the two *data* refusals that command's own Phase 0 raises
  (`CREATE_PRD_BRD_UNALLOCATED` and `CREATE_PRD_BRD_NOT_ELIGIBLE`) — so naming the option where
  either fails would hand the operator a run that stops on its first phase. **Read the dispositions off the
  ledger file, never off a `ledger:` line** — that line's `unallocated` term is a *resolved* count
  that also holds rows the BRD they name has not walked yet (§6.1), so keying the offer to it would
  withhold the option from a slice whose own gate is fully satisfied. Where either test fails, **drop the option
  from the array** and say which one failed: a row still `unallocated` is walked to a
  terminal disposition by `/product-workflows:brd-split <SLICE-KEY>`, which on a slice runs allocate-only,
  while a slice with no `covered-here` row holds no PRD of its own at all and §5 is where its
  requirements went. **Where `coverage-ledger.md` is absent while that `brd-link.md` claims rows** —
  reachable on a `--sent` run, whose step 7 gates no ledger — neither test can be read: drop the
  option, name nothing in its place, and report the missing path, as
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.2 requires (it is not an empty gate set). Dropping rather than annotating is
  this phase's rule for every option whose condition does not hold, and here the condition is a hard
  refusal in another command's Phase 0.
- **`/product-workflows:create-ard <SLICE-KEY>` and `/product-workflows:specify <SLICE-KEY>` are always
  offered**, with no condition of their own, and
  that is read out of their own Phase
  0s rather than assumed symmetric with `/create-prd`'s. Neither consults a tracker, and what each
  reads outside the specs tree — code through `$REPOS_PATH`, documentation through `$DOCS_PATH` — is resolved by that run itself, not
  a condition this command can test for the operator; both run the PRD gate — on every route, as of increment E —
  but neither waits on a PRD, because that gate's `absent` branch proceeds and reports, so
  `/create-prd` on the BRD route is still not a prerequisite for either (`commands/create-ard.md` and
  `commands/specify.md`, *The BRD route runs this gate too, and the `absent` branch is what makes that
  safe*); the one state that would make either wait is a `prd.md` that exists on an unmerged branch,
  which is not a condition this command can test for the operator; and neither reads the
  `claims:` list or the coverage ledger **as an authoring input** — each opens them only to shape
  its own offers and report — because PRD eligibility is §5's rule about authoring
  a **PRD** and an ARD is not that artifact and neither is a specification. What each needs is this
  slice's folder, which `resolve-address` finds at whatever level it sits, plus its own altitude's seed — and an
  absent `ard-seed.md` or `spec-seed.md` is reported by those runs, never a stop. Each takes **one**
  address: a second positional token is refused on every route (`CREATE_ARD_ONE_ADDRESS` /
  `SPECIFY_ONE_ADDRESS`), so neither is ever offered with an Epic beside it.

**Advance and re-entry are two lists, not one, and they are mutually exclusive.** Written as a
single array this phase offered ten options — advancing into the PRD pipeline in the same breath as
naming four different reasons the route is not finished — which is longer than any other list in
this plugin by a wide margin and asks the operator to referee a question this run can answer itself.
Resolve `advance_ready` first, from what **this run actually left behind**, and present exactly one
of the two arrays below.

**`advance_ready: no` where any of these four is true**, each of which is a fact this run holds
rather than a judgement:

| Trigger | Why it blocks advancing |
|---|---|
| this run **reopened** a `[VD#n]` or `[CD#n]` | a `reopened` record "may not be consumed downstream" while it stands (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §3), and all three BRD-route runs consume the register |
| a `[C]` is still **held for the customer** | the customer has not answered it, so a PRD authored now states a scope they were never asked about |
| the review **challenged a code claim**, leaving a finding to re-derive | the findings a downstream artifact would cite are known-stale, and only a `--rebaseline` pass replaces them |
| a dependent BRD's sweep could only be **recorded, not written** | another BRD still carries a position this run's `[CD#n]` overturns, and nothing in it says so yet |

**A `[CD#n]` the will-change rule held open fires none of the four, and that is deliberate.** Its
question is answered, not held (*Freeze the customer decisions*, step 1), so the second trigger does
not fire on it; this run froze it rather than reopening it, so the first does not either; and no
re-entry offered below can close it before its prerequisite ships — packaging again would put a
question whose answer is already on the record, another round has nothing new to put it against,
and a `--rebaseline` pass before the prerequisite ships supersedes its findings with successors still
`will-change`, which `/product-workflows:brd-interview` reads as the record still waiting.
It is `open`, so no downstream run consumes it (`decision-register-format.md` §3): the BRD-route
runs read it and route it to their own open-questions section, as they route a `[VD#n]`
`/product-workflows:brd-interview` deferred under the same rule. It is named in what remains
(below) and in the reconciliation record's *what still needs a human*, with the sequence that
closes it. **One the rule wrote `conditional_on` its prerequisite fires none of the four either**,
for the same first two reasons, but it is `decided`, not `open`: the BRD-route runs consume it as
decided, the propagation sweep reaches it by that field when the prerequisite's decision moves, and
it is named in *what still needs a human* alone.

None true → `advance_ready: yes`. Each re-entry option below is **also** conditioned on its own
trigger and dropped where that trigger did not fire, exactly as the `/create-prd` option is dropped
on a failed eligibility test — so the second array is typically two or three options long, not six.

**`advance_ready: yes` — the route is finished with this slice and crosses into the PRD
pipeline.** Print the full list as prose first, per
`workflows-core:next-phase-offer`'s
overflow rule — five routes do not fit in four slots, and the prose is what carries all of them:

```

**And, in prose beside the array — either array — what this run may have changed commercially.**
**This paragraph is scoped by its own condition and not by the array it sits under**: it is printed
wherever this run froze at least one `[CD#n]`, on an `advance_ready: no` run as much as on a `yes`
one. What makes a run `no` is an open question, an unre-derived finding or an unswept dependent —
none of which bears on whether a customer decision landed, and a run that froze two `[CD#n]` and
then took `advance_ready: no` has changed exactly what this paragraph is about. **It is not the
tier** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §5 fixes *a settled register* as the
test `/brd-package` already applies. **On the ordinary path that test was met before this run
started**: `/brd-package` ran two commands ago and gated on `decisions.md`, so grounding exists, the
register was settled, and the slice was already tier 2. **On a `--sent` run it was not.** That flag
replaces the package gate precisely for a review answering a package this route did not build
(Phase 0, *Resolve inputs and gate the sent package*), so `/brd-package` never ran against this
slice and neither verified grounding nor a settled register is implied by having reached here — such
a slice may still be below tier 2. Assert no tier on that path: §5's ladder grades the folder and
`/prd-proposal` walks it, and this command does neither. **What this run can change is what a
proposal's drivers stand on, and only a run that froze a `[CD#n]` changed it** — on either path.
§8's second evidence class is a **frozen decision**, and a `[CD#n]` this run froze is a customer
decision no proposal written before it could cite, so one written now prices what the customer
agreed rather than what was put to them. **So name the proposal only where this run froze at least
one `[CD#n]`**, and name it with the precondition `/product-workflows:prd-proposal`'s own Phase 0
enforces: it gates `prd.md` on main and stops where the slice holds none (`PRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_PRD`),
which is the ordinary state here, since this route authors the PRD after reconciliation — so the
offer reads **`/product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>` prices this slice once its `prd.md` is
on main — after `/product-workflows:create-prd <SLICE-KEY>` where it holds none yet — and it can
cite the customer decisions this run froze.** **A run that froze none names no proposal**, whichever
path it took: the offer's one reason is a decision this run froze, and there is none to cite. It is
offered in prose rather than as a fifth option because the array is full at four
(`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0) and the three advance options are the route's actual
handover, which an optional, ungated document must not displace. It carries no `<merge-clause>`:
`/product-workflows:prd-proposal` gates on `prd.md`, which this run does not write, so the one wait
its offer names is the PRD's own.

**Reconciling another BRD is on the list and not in the array**, because it is the one lateral move
among four forward ones and this run has just finished the slice it was given. Say so in the line
under the prompt: the list above is longer than the options, and anything on it is reachable through
the free-text option.

**`advance_ready: no` — the three BRD-route options are left out rather than offered and
consumed against an unsettled register**, and each remaining option appears only where its own
trigger above fired. Name, beside the list, which trigger fired and against which id, so the
operator can see what advancing is waiting on rather than only that it is missing:

List every re-entry whose trigger fired as prose, each beside the trigger that fired it:

```
Where this run can go next:

  • Re-ground a moved claim — /product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> --rebaseline <merge-clause>  (<trigger, with the id>)
  • Sweep a dependent       — /product-workflows:brd-reconcile <BRD-KEY> @<review-file>  (<trigger, with the id>)
```

```
choices: ["Stop here — this run's changes are recorded; the route resumes when the items named above are settled", "Work another round — /product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>, for the decision this run reopened or the question it left askable", "Package again — /product-workflows:brd-package <BRD-KEY> <merge-clause>, for the questions still held for the customer", "Re-ground a moved claim — /product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> --rebaseline <merge-clause>"]
```

***Work another round* fires on a reopened decision only where every round of this BRD is closed
once this run's writes land** — read off the round records by the dispositions, as
`/product-workflows:brd-interview` reads them. That command puts a reopened record's question only in
a round it opens, and opens one only once every round is closed (its *A decision reopened
elsewhere*), so where a round stays open — a `[C]` this review left unanswered, say — the bare run
would resume that round and report the record waiting: the no-op offer this phase refuses to make
(below). There, name the reopened record beside the list as waiting behind *Package again*, in the
order the route settles it: the package carries the held questions, this command records their
answers and closes the round, and the next `/brd-interview` run puts the reopened decision's
question. Its other trigger, a question this run left askable, is unchanged.

**The trigger filter runs first and the four-option cap applies to what survives it**
(`workflows-core:next-phase-offer`'s overflow rule). Typically two or three
triggers fire and every one of them fits. Where all four fire, the prose above still names all four
and the array carries `Stop here` plus the three whose triggers this run's own outcome makes most
pressing — say in one line that the list is longer than the options and that the fourth is reachable
through the free-text option.

**"Reconcile another BRD or slice" is on the `advance_ready: yes` list and not on the `advance_ready: no` one**, and the omission is
the point rather than an oversight: it names work on a *different* key, and offering it to an
operator whose current BRD has an unsettled register is how a reopened decision gets left standing
while attention moves elsewhere. The harness's free-text option still reaches it for anyone who means it.

**Dropping the three BRD-route options on an `advance_ready: no` run is a refusal this phase can
make and their own Phase 0s cannot** — unlike the level refusal above, which each of them now makes
for itself. `/create-ard` on the BRD route and `/specify` on the BRD route run no gate that would catch a
reopened decision — their gate on `decisions.md` tests which ref the register is on, never what it
holds — and they read the register and route its `open` and `reopened` records to their own
open-questions section, which is correct behaviour and not a stop. So an operator sent there on an
`advance_ready: no` run gets an artifact built around a hole, with nothing having refused it. This
phase is the only station that knows the reopening happened, which is why the judgement is taken
here.

**All three BRD-route options carry `<merge-clause>`, and that is derived, not decorative.** Each of
`/product-workflows:create-prd`, `/product-workflows:create-ard` and `/product-workflows:specify`
runs `require-on-main` on this slice's `decisions.md` before it reads the register on the BRD route
(`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.4's rows for them), and `decisions.md` is one of the files this
run's *Handoff* phase lands — so each would stop on a register this run wrote and has not merged,
and an offer that did not say so would send the operator into that stop unwarned. This run emits two
`Phase handoff:` lines, and the clause resolves from the *Handoff* phase's — the one reporting the
artifact those gates target — never from the canonicalised review's
(`workflows-core:next-phase-offer`, *where a run emitted more than one*). **What the clause does not
cover** is each command's other gate: `/create-prd`'s on `idea.md`, a file no `/brd-*` command writes
and one the BRD route resolves no ladder for, and `/create-ard`'s and `/specify`'s on `prd.md`, a
file this run does not write either — the same derivation this phase applies to
`/product-workflows:prd-proposal`'s offer — so neither of those adds a wait the clause could name.

**No option carries a `(Recommended)` marker, and that omission is deliberate**, per the
`When no option is safe to recommend` guidance in
`workflows-core:escalation-rules`: which one is right depends entirely on what
this reconciliation left behind, and the reason is stated here, beside the list, rather than folded
into a conditional marker the orchestrator would then have to evaluate. **An option whose condition
does not hold is dropped, never annotated** — the `/create-prd` option on a failed eligibility test,
and each re-entry option whose trigger did not fire — which is what keeps the list honourable
verbatim: an operator whose run reopened nothing is never shown the *Work another round* option at
all, rather than being offered a run that would report there is nothing new to ask. What an option
that survives carries is the reason it was offered — in its own label, and for a re-entry option in
the trigger and id printed beside the list — and its wait, the `<merge-clause>`, wherever it names a
gate this run feeds.

**The dependent-sweep option names its own wait, and deliberately not `<merge-clause>`.** What it
waits on is the *dependent's* register reaching the default branch, while the placeholder
`workflows-core:next-phase-offer` defines resolves from **this** run's own
`Phase handoff:` outcome line — a different merge, which is why the condition is written in the
option's own text like every other one in the list.

**Beside either list, name `/product-workflows:brd-interview <DEPENDENT-KEY>` for every record
this run's propagation sweep wrote `reopened` in a dependent BRD**, one line per dependent, with
each record by id qualified as that sweep names it. That dependent's own next `/brd-interview` run
puts the record's question again (its *A decision reopened elsewhere*). On the dependent's side
that run is named only by a `/brd-interview` run already made there, whose *Next steps* names it
where the record waited on the round that run worked; until one is made, nothing on the dependent's
side names it, so this is the first place it is named. It is prose and never an
array option — it names work on a different key — and it carries no `<merge-clause>`: that command
gates on the dependent's `grounding/code-grounding.md`, which this run never writes. A dependent
recorded-not-written has no such line, since nothing was reopened there yet.

Say plainly what remains, per `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "next-phase-offer")` — names only,
never behaviour a command of its own owns: a `[C]` the review did not answer keeps its round open and
travels in the next package; a decision this run reopened is settled by another interview round,
once every round is closed; a record the sweep reopened in a dependent, by that dependent's own
interview round; a
challenged code claim is settled by a grounding pass and by nothing here, and a decision any
finding of which that pass supersedes is reopened or put again by the next
`/product-workflows:brd-interview` round where that command's *A decision the re-grounding moved*
says so; a `[CD#n]` the
will-change rule held open stays `open` until its prerequisite ships, a `--rebaseline` grounding
pass supersedes the findings it rests on with successors no longer `will-change`, and a later
interview round puts its question against them; and a dependent BRD recorded-not-written stays unswept until its own register is on the
default branch.

### Context hygiene

The resume pointer is written in the terminal cost phase, per
`workflows-core:session-hygiene` §1. **The offer above spans roles, so both
branches are printed** (§2's *Next options span both* bullet). Reconciling a second review for the
same BRD, or working another round of it, or authoring this slice's PRD yourself as PM
(`/product-workflows:create-prd <SLICE-KEY>`)? → run **`/compact`**. Moving to a different BRD or
slice, or handing on to PA (`/product-workflows:create-ard <SLICE-KEY>`) or PE
(`/product-workflows:specify <SLICE-KEY>`), even when the same person does it? → run
**`/clear`**; those runs read the reconciled folder from the specs repo, not from this session.
Guidance only — nothing is auto-run.

## Phase 15 — Session maintenance, feedback & cost

Terminal phase — runs after *Next steps*, and NEVER interrupts an earlier phase.

**Capture-at-block invariant.** If an EARLIER phase halts on a plugin / skill / command / reference
gap, `emit-block` (`workflows-core:feedback-emission`) fires at that halt before escalating. One of
this command's stops qualifies and is the reason the invariant is named here:
`BRD_RECONCILE_READER_CONTRACT` is an agent-contract gap — a dispatch this command owns that its own
agent refused. **Every other stop fails that test and is classified by it, never by a list**: each
reports the operator's own arguments, the tree, the environment, the customer's file, or a gate
working — never a capability, reference or command path this plugin lacks. Among them: a missing or
malformed key, an unreadable review or `--sent` path (`BRD_RECONCILE_SENT_NOT_READABLE`), a `--sent`
given where a handed-off package already exists (`BRD_RECONCILE_SENT_REDUNDANT`), an unresolved BRD,
a resolved root BRD, a resolved Epic folder (`BRD_RECONCILE_EPIC_LEVEL`), an idea-route PRD folder (`BRD_RECONCILE_NOT_A_SLICE`), an ungated or absent package, a review file that already exists under a
different content, and an unset `$SPECS_PATH` are environment or sequencing halts;
`BRD_RECONCILE_EMPTY_DIGEST` is a returned review the reader's digest cannot be squared with — a
well-formed return over the customer's own file, which the stop's own text puts down to either a
parse that failed or a review that contradicts itself, and nothing in the run tells those apart; it
is not a dispatch the agent refused, the file is the customer's rather than one of the plugin's own
records, and the operator settles it by opening that file and re-running with it read as prose; and
`BRD_RECONCILE_UNCONFIRMED`, `BRD_RECONCILE_UNDISPOSED_CORRECTION` and `BRD_RECONCILE_UNSWEPT` are
the gates working.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (subagent_type: "workflows-core:impl-maintenance", model:
   `<detection_model>`) with a compact handoff: command `/brd-reconcile`; what was produced (the
   canonicalised review, the frozen `[CD#n]`, the banners, the reconciliation record); key events
   (the mode the review arrived in, a candidate sent back to the customer, a reason left `not
   stated`, a refused correction, a dependent recorded-not-written, a stale-reference hit needing a
   human — or "none"); workarounds; test result N/A; project root = the BRD folder.
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "feedback-emission emit-auto")` and call its `emit-auto` entry point (§6)
   with the Lessons Learned report, `command: /brd-reconcile`, the run's `key` (the
   `<BRD-KEY>`), `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Surface the persisted path (or "no
   plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted").
3. **Session cost (ALWAYS runs).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "cost-emission emit-cost")` and call its `emit-cost` entry point with `command: /brd-reconcile`, `phase: brd-to-prd`, `role: pm`, the
   run's `key`, `source`, and `plugin_version`. Surface the persisted path (or the report-only
   notice).
4. **Write the resume pointer.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "session-hygiene")` and, per its §1, write/overwrite `<BRD-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` now — after the cost entry, before the commit
   step below. Redact per §1. Silent.
5. **Commit session artifacts (terminal).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git commit-artifacts")` and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — the LAST action of the run. Stages ONLY the §2.1 bounded artifact paths inside
   `$SPECS_PATH`, commits `<BRD-KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (/brd-reconcile)` with no
   `Co-Authored-By` trailer, and pushes to the branch the handoff phases created. NEVER touches a code
   repo, a docs repo or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository; NEVER force-pushes; NEVER fails the
   run; skips entirely when the run carries `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting that notice.
   Hold its §6 outcome line for the final report.

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits the deliverable (git for the deliverable is
offered only in the two handoff phases), and NEVER writes into a code/docs repo, or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository; no user name is ever written.

## Final report

Report: the BRD folder and which level it sits at; the classification and model routing
(+ any Opus degradation); **the review** — the canonicalised path, the original path, the mode and
what decided it, the verdict, the readiness statement quoted verbatim, and the evidence limitations
as stated or the fact that they were not; **every anomaly**, unrepaired, because each one changes how
the rest of the review should be read; every torn write found (`decision-register-format.md` §8), by
id or heading, with `/product-workflows:brd-interview` as the run that removes it, and every answer
carried `unmatched` because it cited one; **every `[CD#n]` frozen**, with what it answers and its
status — naming, for each the will-change rule bound, the `conditional_on` it wrote or that it held
the record open — every candidate rejected or sent back to the customer with its reason, and every candidate
the operator re-pointed onto a question, with the target the reader returned; the `[C]`
questions closed and every one still open, with the round each sits in; every `[AS#n]` superseded and
every `[VD#n]` or `[CD#n]` reopened or superseded here, and every `[CD#n]` re-decided in place; the corrections grouped by disposition, with every refusal's reason
stated in full; every dated artifact bannered, and every overturned bundle document named rather than
bannered; the defect resolutions with the log's path; the ledger rows moved; **the propagation
sweep** — per dependent BRD, the `conditional_on` positions first, then the citing items, each with
its disposition, plus every dependent recorded-not-written with its concrete state; **the
stale cross-reference sweep** — the hit counts by outcome and every `needs-a-human` hit named;
**what still needs a human**, in full; the artifacts written, by path; the feedback + cost paths;
**both** `Phase handoff:` outcome lines — §4.1 counts one **per handoff offered** and this command
offers two — **each labelled with the handoff it reports and neither printed bare**, as that
section requires of a multi-handoff producer: the review's and the run's, in that order, the run's
being the one a `<merge-clause>` resolves from (`workflows-core:next-phase-offer`); the
`Specs repo:` outcome line (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §6); the next-step
recommendation; and end with the ledger line, read fresh from `coverage-ledger.md` **as this run
left it**, exactly per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §6:

```
ledger: <N> requirements — <covered> covered, <deferred> deferred, <rejected> rejected, <unallocated> unallocated, <unresolved> unresolved (<delegated> delegated, <not-built> not built)
```

**Reporting it reads one ledger per `covered-by` row**, one hop, from the working tree via
`resolve-address` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3), per `coverage-ledger-format.md` §6.1 — this run always stands on a slice
(on the ordinary path, step 6 already confirmed a `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md` is on main,
and that file is created only by `/brd-package`, which itself refuses to run on a root — this
command later banners it, and refuses a root too), so
that is always a sibling or the parent (§3); a ledger that cannot be
read there contributes `unresolved`, never `covered` (§6.2). Every term is a **resolved** count, and
the `unallocated` term does not track the allocation gate — a non-zero one here is a row this BRD
delegated to a BRD that has not walked it yet, which is the resolution working and never this run
having left something undone. A slice does **not** always reach this with
nothing to resolve. `covered-by` is legal on a slice (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3), where it
names a sibling under the same parent or that parent and marks an **orphan row** — a ledger row for a `[BR#n]` this slice no longer claims, reached by either of the first two of §2's routes, the only two that write `covered-by`: the parent's walk withdrawing a claim that was never more than provisional, or a re-cut moving a claim the slice had committed to and then recorded it would not build (§3.2). Those rows are resolved one hop exactly like a parent's
delegated rows, so a slice reports zero delegated only when its parent withdrew none of its
claims.
