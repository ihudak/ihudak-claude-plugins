name: prose-style-refresh
description: >
  Refreshes your organization's prose style overlay from the source you configured —
  a set of style-guide URLs, a git repository, or a local directory. Distils the
  source into the plugin's eight reference-file structure and writes the result into
  your overlay directory. Never modifies the shipped vendor-neutral baseline, and
  carries no hardcoded style-guide URL.

# Refresh the prose style overlay

Regenerates the overlay rules from **your** configured style-guide source. The plugin
ships no vendor's style guide and this command fetches from no fixed site: the source
is whatever your `source.yml` declares, or whatever you pass on the command line.

## Arguments

| Argument | Example | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | `/prose-style-refresh` | Uses the configured `source.yml` |
| `--source <url>` | `--source https://style.example.com/docs` | One-off web source; may be repeated |
| `--from <path>` | `--from ~/company-style-guide/` | One-off local directory or file source |
| `--rules <path>` | `--rules ~/style/rules` | Write to this overlay directory instead of the discovered one |
| `--dry-run` | `--dry-run` | Report what would change; write nothing |

## Procedure

### 0. Resolve the baseline directory

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` does **not** expand in a slash-command body. Invoke the
`prose-style-rules` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "prose-style:prose-style-rules"`), which
resolves it, and take from it the absolute path of the shipped baseline directory —
the one holding `terminology.md`, `word-list.md`, and the other six reference files.

Everything below calls that resolved path **`<baseline>`**. It is a read-only input to
this command: the structure to map onto, and the one path that must never be written to.

### 1. Resolve the overlay directory (the write target)

Take the FIRST that resolves:

1. `--rules <path>`, when given.
2. `<repo-root>/.prose-style/rules/` — `<repo-root>` from
   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, falling back to the working directory.
3. `$PROSE_STYLE_PATH`.

If none exists yet, tell the user which path you would create — default
`<repo-root>/.prose-style/rules/` — and ask for confirmation before creating it. Do not
create a directory tree unasked.

**The shipped baseline at `<baseline>` is never a write target.**
It is the vendor-neutral fallback, it is reinstalled with the plugin, and anything
written there is lost on the next update. Refuse a `--rules` path that resolves inside
`<baseline>` or its parent plugin directory, and say why.

### 2. Resolve the source

Take the FIRST that resolves:

1. `--source` / `--from` arguments, when given.
2. `<overlay directory>/source.yml`.

If neither resolves, do not guess a URL. Ask the user:

> "This plugin has no built-in style-guide source. Where should the rules come from —
> a set of URLs, a git repository, or a local directory?"

Then offer to write their answer to `<overlay directory>/source.yml` so the next
refresh needs no arguments.

#### `source.yml` schema

```yaml
# Where your style guide lives. Exactly one `kind` per source entry.
sources:
  - kind: web                    # fetch pages over HTTP
    pages:
      terminology:      ["https://style.example.com/terms", "https://style.example.com/trademarks"]
      word-list:        ["https://style.example.com/word-list"]
      voice-and-tone:   ["https://style.example.com/voice"]
      grammar:          ["https://style.example.com/grammar"]
      formatting:       ["https://style.example.com/numbers", "https://style.example.com/punctuation"]
      ui-interactions:  ["https://style.example.com/ui"]
      accessibility:    ["https://style.example.com/inclusive-language"]
      top-10-tips:      ["https://style.example.com/tips"]

  - kind: git                    # clone or pull a repo of style docs
    repo: git@github.example.com:org/style-guide.git
    ref: main
    path: docs/style             # subdirectory within the repo

  - kind: local                  # read a directory or a single file already on disk
    path: ~/company-style-guide/

# Optional. Defaults to all eight when omitted.
targets: [terminology, word-list, voice-and-tone, grammar, formatting,
          ui-interactions, accessibility, top-10-tips]

# Optional. `layer` (default) keeps the baseline underneath each generated file;
# `replace` writes the `<!-- prose-style: replace -->` marker into every generated file
# so it supersedes the baseline outright.
mode: layer
```

Multiple `sources` entries are read in order and merged; a later entry wins on conflict.

### 3. Fetch

- **web** — fetch each URL. If a page is paginated or truncated, fetch with a larger
  `max_length` and continue with `start_index`. A URL that fails is reported and
  skipped; it never aborts the run.
- **git** — clone into a temporary directory, or `git -C <clone> pull --ff-only` if it
  is already there, then read from `path`. Never write into the source repository.
- **local** — read the directory or file directly. Read-only; never modify the source.

If every source fails, report the failure and leave the existing overlay unchanged.
Exit without writing.

### 4. Distil into the reference structure

For each target file:

- Read the **existing overlay file** if there is one, to see the current structure and
  what has already been captured.
- Read the corresponding **baseline** file under `<baseline>` to see
  the section headings and table shapes the checker expects.
- Map the fetched content onto that structure: same file name, same heading levels, same
  `✅` / `❌` table shape. `terminology.md` and `word-list.md` have documented entry
  schemas at the end of their baseline files — follow them exactly, because the checker
  reads those tables structurally.
- **Distil, never transcribe.** Turn prose guidance into concrete, checkable rules with
  examples. A rule a checker cannot test against a line of text does not belong in the
  output.
- **Write only what the source actually says.** Never carry a rule over from the
  baseline into the overlay, and never invent one to fill a section. An empty section is
  correct when the source is silent — the baseline still covers it underneath.
- When `mode: replace`, put `<!-- prose-style: replace -->` on the first line of each
  generated file.
- Preserve any `## Allowed` section already present in the overlay file unless the
  source contradicts it; those are deliberate local exceptions.

### 5. Write

Write the generated files into the overlay directory. Under `--dry-run`, write nothing
and print the diff instead.

Files that would be identical are left untouched, so timestamps and version control
stay meaningful.

### 6. Report

Summarise per file:

- Rules added
- Rules changed
- Rules removed
- Terminology entries added or removed
- Sources that failed and were skipped

If nothing changed, say the overlay is already up to date.

Close with the resolved paths, so the next run is unambiguous:

```
Source:  <resolved source description>
Overlay: <absolute path to the overlay directory>
Baseline: <baseline>  (unchanged — always)
```

## Hard rules

- **No hardcoded style-guide source.** This command knows no vendor's URL. If the user
  has configured nothing and passed nothing, it asks — it never guesses.
- **Never write into `<baseline>` or anywhere else under the installed plugin.** The
  baseline is the fallback; a refresh
  writes only the overlay.
- **Never write into the source.** A git source is cloned read-only; a local source is
  read, never edited.
- **Never invent a rule.** Every generated line traces to the fetched source. A silent
  source produces an empty section, not a guess.
- **Keep the eight file names and their structure.** `prose-style-checker` and
  `prose-style-rules` both read them by name.
- **A failed source is reported, not fatal.** Partial refreshes are fine; a total
  failure leaves the overlay exactly as it was.
- **Credentials are the user's.** Use whatever git or network auth is already
  configured; never prompt for, store, or echo a secret.
