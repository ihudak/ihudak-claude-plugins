# Review documentation changes from a pull request

Reviews the markdown files changed in a pull request against the active prose style
rules — the plugin's vendor-neutral baseline, plus your organization's overlay when one
is configured. Outputs a structured violation report.

## Arguments

The command receives its input via `$ARGUMENTS`. Accepted formats:

| Format | Example | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| PR number | `9089` | Finds merge commit or remote branch for that PR |
| Branch name | `feat/improve-install-guide` | Diffs the branch against the default branch (`main` unless the repository's is another) |
| `--repo <path>` | `--repo /workspace/product-docs` | Override the repo path (default: current working directory) |
| `--doc-type <type>` | `--doc-type product-docs` | Passed to prose-style-checker for severity calibration (default: `product-docs`) |
| `--rules <path>` | `--rules ~/style/rules` | Override overlay discovery; passed to prose-style-checker as `rules_path` |

Arguments can be combined: `9089 --repo /workspace/product-docs`.

If no arguments are provided, ask the user for a PR number or branch name.

## Procedure

### 1. Parse arguments

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **target**: the PR number (all digits) or branch name (anything else that is not a flag).
- **repo_path**: value after `--repo`, or the current working directory if absent.
- **doc_type**: value after `--doc-type`, or `product-docs` if absent.
- **rules_path**: value after `--rules`, or absent.

If no target is found, ask the user: "Please provide a PR number or source branch name."

### 2. Resolve changed files

Run every git command with `git -C <repo_path>`.

**The default branch.** Every diff below that names the default branch, and step 7's, writes it
as `main`. Where the repository's is another, put its **name** in `main`'s place:
`origin/<name>...origin/<branch>`, `<name>...<branch>`, `<name>...remotes/origin/<branch>`. Take
the name from `git -C <repo_path> symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, which
prints `origin/<name>`: the name is what follows `origin/`. Without `--short` the command prints
`refs/remotes/origin/<name>`, which is not a name — in `origin/main`'s place it makes
`origin/refs/remotes/origin/<name>`, a revision git rejects, and in the other two it turns a diff
against the local branch into one against the remote. It counts only where
`git -C <repo_path> rev-parse --verify --quiet origin/<name> >/dev/null` succeeds for that name: a
remote that renamed its default branch, fetched with `--prune`, leaves `origin/HEAD` naming the
branch it deleted, and each diff below that names the default branch would then name a ref git
rejects. Where it prints nothing
(`origin/HEAD` is unset), or a name that probe rejects, the name is `master` if
`git -C <repo_path> rev-parse --verify --quiet origin/master >/dev/null` succeeds and the same
probe of `origin/main` does not; otherwise it stays `main`.

#### 2a. If target is a PR number

```bash
# Look for the merge commit in ALL branches/tags
git -C <repo_path> log --all --oneline --grep="Pull request #<NUMBER>:" | head -5
```

Repositories that use GitHub's default merge subject line record it differently — if
the search above finds nothing, retry with `--grep="(#<NUMBER>)"` before falling
through to the branch search.

- **Merge commit found** (PR is merged):
  - Extract the commit SHA.
  - Get the diff: `git -C <repo_path> diff <SHA>^..<SHA> --name-only -- '*.md'`
  - This gives the list of changed markdown files.

- **No merge commit** (PR is open/unmerged):
  - Search remote branches for the PR number or related branch:
    ```bash
    git -C <repo_path> fetch --all --prune 2>/dev/null
    git -C <repo_path> branch -r | grep -i "<NUMBER>" | head -5
    ```
  - If a matching remote branch is found, diff it:
    ```bash
    git -C <repo_path> diff origin/main...origin/<branch> --name-only -- '*.md'
    ```
  - If no branch is found, tell the user:
    "Could not find PR #<NUMBER> in the local git history or remote branches.
    Try providing the source branch name instead."

#### 2b. If target is a branch name

```bash
git -C <repo_path> fetch origin <branch> 2>/dev/null
git -C <repo_path> diff origin/main...origin/<branch> --name-only -- '*.md'
```

If the diff is empty, also try `main...<branch>` (local branch) and
`main...remotes/origin/<branch>`. Where the default branch is not `main`, each form takes its
name instead (**The default branch**, above).

### 3. Filter to documentation files

From the list of changed files, keep only `.md` files. Exclude:
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `RELEASING.md` (repo meta files)
- Files under `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `vendor/`, `build/`, `dist/`

If no documentation files remain after filtering, report:
"No documentation markdown files were changed in this PR."

### 4. Verify files exist on disk

For each changed file, check if it exists in the working tree. Files that were
deleted in the PR won't exist — skip those and note them in the report.

For files that exist, resolve to absolute paths.

### 5. Run prose-style-checker

Invoke the `prose-style-checker` agent (`subagent_type: prose-style:prose-style-checker`)
with:

```yaml
files:      [<absolute paths of existing changed files>]
doc_type:   <doc_type from arguments>
rules_path: <rules_path from arguments, when provided>
```

Collect the violation report, including its `rules_source` field.

### 6. Run Vale (optional)

Find the Vale configuration: look in `<repo_path>` and then in each directory above it up to
`<repo_root>`, the nearest first, where `<repo_root>` is what
`git -C <repo_path> rev-parse --show-toplevel` prints — the order Vale's own search takes, climbing
from the directory it runs in. In each directory look for all five names Vale reads its
configuration from, not only `.vale.ini`: `.vale`, `_vale`, `vale.ini`, `.vale.ini` and
`_vale.ini`, of which Vale takes, in one directory, the first in that order (Vale 3.21) — so a
repository whose only one is `_vale.ini` is linted all the same. The nearest directory holding one
is the one Vale must read from, and `<vale_root>` is that directory. If there is one:

```bash
which vale 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"
```

If Vale is installed and a configuration file was found, run it on the changed files **from `<vale_root>`**,
in one Bash call, in the form that configuration file decides — whether it sets `StylesPath`, a
`StylesPath` key, written with `=` or `:`, with the case as written, above its first `[section]`
header, the one place Vale accepts the key (a key in any other case Vale ignores, with `W101`):

```bash
# The configuration sets StylesPath:
(builtin cd "<vale_root>" >/dev/null && unset VALE_CONFIG_PATH && command vale --no-global --output=line <file1> <file2> ... 2>&1)
# It sets none:
(builtin cd "<vale_root>" >/dev/null && unset VALE_CONFIG_PATH && h=$(command mktemp -d) && { XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$h" command vale --output=line <file1> <file2> ... 2>&1; s=$?; command rm -r -- "$h"; exit $s; })
```

Vale looks for its configuration in the directory it runs in and then in each directory above it,
uses the first it finds, and never looks beside the files; this command's shell stands wherever the
session does — which is what `--repo` exists to differ from. Run from `<vale_root>`, Vale reads its
configuration there. Run from a directory outside `<vale_root>`'s tree — the session's, say — it reads
the first configuration at or above that directory instead, which may be another repository's; where
there is none, it stops with `E100 [.vale.ini not found]`, since both forms below set the user's
global configuration aside. The subshell keeps the `cd` to this one call, and the file paths are
step 4's absolute ones, so they resolve from `<vale_root>` too. It is `builtin cd`, its output
discarded, because this command's shell carries the user's aliases and shell functions: a `cd` of
theirs would otherwise run in its place, and one that prints would put its output ahead of Vale's.
`builtin`, not `command`: the shell is bash or zsh, and zsh's `command` runs no builtin. For the
same reason `mktemp`, `vale` and `rm` run as `command <name>` — an `rm -i` or `rm -I` alias would
ask before removing the directory, be answered no from an empty standard input, and leave the
directory behind — and `--` ends `rm`'s options.

**This is the one definition of the form this plugin runs Vale in** — `/prose-review-docs` step 5
cites it — **and every part of both forms is load-bearing** (Vale 3.21, measured, and read from
its source). The run reads the repository's configuration with no global Vale configuration and no
`VALE_CONFIG_PATH`, and with the styles that configuration reads. Vale merges the user's global configuration file —
`~/.config/vale/.vale.ini` on Linux, wherever `vale ls-dirs` names it elsewhere — under the
repository's, so a style enabled only on this machine raises findings the repository's rules never
would, and a rule turned off only on this machine goes silent where the repository enables it.
`--no-global` drops that file **and Vale's default StylesPath with it**: Vale adds its default path
only where `--no-global` is absent, and `VALE_STYLES_PATH` does not bring it back. That is right
only where the configuration names a StylesPath of its own, whose styles are then the repository's.
Where it sets none, its synced packages and custom styles live in the default path, a layout Vale
documents as valid, and `--no-global` stops the run with
`E100 … style '<name>' does not exist on StylesPath` in place of the findings. So that form keeps
the default path and sets aside the global file alone: Vale looks for that file under
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, a fresh, empty directory there holds none, and the default StylesPath comes from
`XDG_DATA_HOME`, or `VALE_STYLES_PATH` where that is set, which the form leaves as they are; it
removes the directory it made and exits with Vale's status. **That is also the second form's
limit**: the default StylesPath is one directory for every project on the machine whose
configuration sets no `StylesPath`, and Vale reads every configuration file in its
`.vale-config/`, ahead of the repository's own — the configuration a package such as `Hugo` or
`MDX` ships, which `vale sync` writes there after clearing what the last sync into it left. So
what it holds is whatever the machine's latest `vale sync` into that directory wrote, another
project's included, and until this repository is synced again the run can raise what a clean
runner does not, or stay silent where one raises. This command never syncs to cure it; the
remedy is `vale sync` for this repository, in the same form. And `VALE_CONFIG_PATH`, where the
environment sets it, names a file Vale reads **instead** of searching, so the repository's own is
never read; neither `--no-global` nor `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` stops that, and clearing it in the subshell
does.

Collect Vale findings separately. If Vale is not installed, note:
"Vale is not installed — skipping automated linting. Style check is based on
prose-style-checker only."

### 7. Get the diff context

For each file with violations, get the actual diff hunks to show what changed:

```bash
# For merged PRs:
git -C <repo_path> diff <SHA>^..<SHA> -- <file>

# For branches:
git -C <repo_path> diff origin/main...origin/<branch> -- <file>
```

This helps the user see violations in context of what was changed.

### 8. Report

Output a structured report:

```markdown
## PR review: #<NUMBER> (or branch: <name>)

### Summary
- Files changed: X documentation files (Y deleted, skipped)
- Rules: <rules_source — "baseline" or "overlay: <path>">
- Style violations: X (MAJOR: N, MINOR: N, NIT: N)
- Vale findings: X (error: N, warning: N, suggestion: N)  — or "N/A (Vale not available)"

### Violations by file

#### `<relative-path>`

| Line | Severity | Rule | Message | Suggestion |
|------|----------|------|---------|------------|
| 42   | MAJOR    | Prose.Terminology.WrongTerm | ... | ... |

<diff context showing the changed lines around the violation>

#### `<next-file>`
...

### Vale findings (if available)
<Vale output grouped by file>

### Deleted files (skipped)
- `path/to/deleted.md`

### Recommendations
<Top 3 most impactful things to fix, prioritised by severity>
```

The `Rules:` line is the only place the overlay is reported. Do not warn when no overlay
resolved — the baseline is a valid, complete rule set.

### 9. Offer to fix

After the report, ask:
"Would you like me to fix the violations I found? I can apply safe, mechanical
fixes (terminology, excluded words, formatting). Ambiguous cases will be skipped."

If the user says yes, invoke the `prose-fixer` agent
(`subagent_type: prose-style:prose-fixer`) with the violation list and the file paths.

## Hard rules

- **Work in any repo** — don't assume a particular docs-repo layout. Optimise for
  repos with a merge-commit convention (`Pull request #<N>: …` or `… (#<N>)`), and fall
  back to branch diffing when neither matches.
- **Never modify files** during the review phase. Fixes happen only via
  `prose-fixer` and only when the user explicitly approves.
- **Show violations in diff context** so the user can see what changed alongside
  what violated the style rules.
- **Respect .gitignore** — don't review generated or vendored files.
- **A missing overlay is never an error.** Report the resolved rule source once and
  move on.
- **If git operations fail**, report the error clearly and suggest the user
  provide a branch name or file paths directly.
