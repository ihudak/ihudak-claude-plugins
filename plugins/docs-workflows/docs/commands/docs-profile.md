# /docs-profile

Scans a documentation repository and writes or refreshes its machine-readable `.dev-workflows/docs-profile.yml` plus complementary CLAUDE.md guidance, as a reviewable PR.

## Who runs it

`/docs-profile` runs outside the role pipeline — no role, no cost-attribution phase (`workflows-core:cost-emission` gives it no attribution row — it appears there only in §7's list of commands with nothing to inherit). [Workflow overview](../workflow.md) draws it outside the documentation spine, as the setup utility `/document` reads the output of. It is also one of the two commands here that emit no cost entry, with [`/docs-serve`](docs-serve.md). It does invoke the `workflows-core:model-routing` skill, though, and classifies itself `SIGNIFICANT`, since a wrong profile steers every later [`/document`](document.md) run.

## Synopsis

```
/docs-profile [<repo-path>] [--inline]
```

`--inline` is stripped from `$ARGUMENTS` before the remaining token is read as the optional docs-repo path (Phase 0). `--inline` is the flag `/document` (keyed mode) passes when it invokes this flow itself, from its own Phase 0 — it skips the branch-name prompt in favour of a deterministic branch name, and hands the PR draft back to `/document` instead of reporting one itself. Where a branch of that name is already there, left by an earlier inline run that stopped after profiling, it stops with `DOCS_PROFILE_BOOTSTRAP_BRANCH_EXISTS`, naming the branch, its base and where it forked, rather than switch onto it — at once, before it scans the repository or asks anything; delete or merge that branch, then re-run.

## What it needs

- **A docs repository** — resolved by `resolve-docs-repo` (`docs-workflow/repo-resolution.md` §1), the same signal-positive ladder `/docs-workflows:docs-serve` and `/docs-workflows:docs-brand` use: the given path, else the working directory when it carries a docs signal, else `$DOCS_PATH` when it carries one, else a search under `$REPOS_PATH`, else a question — each conditional rung tested against a docs-repo signal; the first rung takes an explicit path as given, with no signal test. It must additionally be a writeable git work tree; not a work tree, or not writeable, stops with a named error. The profile is read and written at that work tree's top level — its one home, where every path it records is rooted and every command it records runs — even where the resolved path is a site below it. A resolved target that still carries zero signals — reachable only through that first, untested rung, or through the resolver's own generic question — is not refused: this command asks its own, narrower question, specifically whether to profile it anyway, since a repo the resolver would never have found on its own is exactly the case `/docs-profile` still needs to serve.
- Nothing from `$SPECS_PATH` — the scan and the write both happen inside the target repo itself, and this command runs no specs-preflight and no `commit-artifacts` step.
- **`$GIT_USER_INITIALS`** (optional) — used in standalone mode's branch-naming ladder, both to fill an identity placeholder in a convention the repo already documents, and as the fallback prefix when the repo documents no convention at all.

## What it produces

A two-stage read: a Sonnet-tier detection pass (mechanical repo scanning — package scripts, cross-space override manifests, shared registries, templating tokens, content/snippet roots, branch-naming and image conventions, prerequisites, announcement pages), then an Opus-tier synthesis that turns the detection report into a draft `docs-profile.yml` conforming to `docs-profiles/docs-profile-schema.md`. After you fill any gap the synthesis flagged, it writes `<repo-root>/.dev-workflows/docs-profile.yml` plus minimal CLAUDE.md additions on a new branch, as one commit, then drafts a copy-paste-ready PR title and body. **It never pushes, and never opens the PR itself** — you push the branch and open the PR yourself. An existing profile is refreshed, never silently overwritten: a field-level diff is shown and confirmed before any change is applied. Declining it with **Keep existing, write nothing** ends the run there, with no branch, no stash and no commit, and a report saying the profile was kept; run inline from `/document`, it hands the existing profile back instead, and `/document` proceeds with it. A refresh whose diff lists no change ends the same way without asking, and reports the profile up to date. A refresh proposes a change only where the scan detected a value — or where the existing value is one the schema no longer accepts, below — and it never deletes a field because the scan found nothing for it. Every field it detected nothing for is kept as it stands and listed as kept — on a profile [`/docs-init`](docs-init.md) wrote, that includes `builds[]`, `generator` and the dev servers, and the `images` block where the scan finds no image policy — so a refresh never degrades a profile its scan cannot fully read. The image policy is a detected field like any other, proposed through the diff; and a profile written before `images.policy` became a three-value enum, whose policy is still a free-text sentence, has it listed in the diff as non-conforming and replaced — asked for where the scan found none — never carried forward into a file that has to conform.

A dev server's `command` gets the `{port}` token only where the detected command already names that server's port as a literal number, which the token then replaces. The token is how [`/docs-serve`](docs-serve.md) serves on a port other than the configured one. Where the port lives inside a script instead, as in `pnpm cloud:start`, the command is written as detected, and the report lists it as **fixed-port**: `/docs-serve` cannot fall forward from a collision on it, and `--port` cannot move it. This command never invents a flag or an argument-forwarding form to pass the port through. Whether a tool accepts one depends on the tool, and the schema's field rule shows how to add the token by hand where it does. A token you add by hand survives a refresh, whether it stands in place of a port the command already names or in arguments you forward after the detected command, as in `pnpm docs:start -- --port {port}` where the scan finds `pnpm docs:start`: the refresh treats either as the command it detected, keeps yours, and lists it in the diff as kept. A command you rewrote in any other way is compared as written, so the diff proposes the detected form in its place — shown, never applied unconfirmed.

The report also lists every dev-server command the schema's field rules call a profile defect — one that binds only the loopback, one that detaches its server, and one that runs a Vite-based tool such as VitePress without `--strictPort`, which moves off a busy port instead of failing — each with the rule it breaks and how to fix it. It fixes none of them itself: which flag a tool takes is the tool's business, so the command stays as detected and you edit it by hand.

## Gates

No reviewer agent, and no Opus review gate in the code-review sense — every checkpoint here is a user confirmation rather than an automated review: whether to proceed at all when no docs-repo signal is detected (Phase 0), each field the synthesis flagged as unconfirmed plus a field-level diff before overwriting an existing profile (Phase 4), and the branch name and a dirty working tree before anything is written (Phase 5). Nothing downstream re-reviews the profile once written.

## Example

```
/docs-workflows:docs-profile ~/repos/example-docs
```

Detects its content roots, drafts `spaces[]` and `dev_servers` from the Sonnet-tier scan, synthesises the full profile on Opus, asks about any field the synthesis flagged as unconfirmed, writes `.dev-workflows/docs-profile.yml` plus CLAUDE.md additions on a new branch, commits, and prints the branch name and a drafted PR title/body for you to push.
