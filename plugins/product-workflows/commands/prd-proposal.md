name: prd-proposal
description: Effort-proposal workflow (PM phase, optional and ungated on both routes) — author a customer-facing effort proposal for one PRD- folder. Grades the folder against four readiness tiers rather than gating on an ARD or a specification, and the tier caps how confident any work package may be. Derives work packages by delivery seam, hours by package and role, and a range computed bottom-up from per-package confidence; every cost driver cites a verified grounding finding, a frozen decision or a confirmed code defect, and a driver citing none of the three does not render. Creates a defect-remediation package automatically from three defect sources and never offers it as a scope lever. Writes proposal.md and a derived proposal-brief.md from one resolved data set, archives the prior revision, and gates on the Opus proposal-reviewer. Carries no money for human hours at any tier. Nothing downstream reads a proposal or waits on one.

Author a customer-facing effort proposal for the resolved PRD folder: $ARGUMENTS

**Core references.** A citation of the form `workflows-core:<name>` names a shared reference in the `workflows-core` plugin. Load it with `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "<name>")` — never by path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to this plugin, which does not carry it.

`/prd-proposal` is the **effort-proposal step** (PM phase) — it takes one `PRD-` folder, grades how much
evidence stands behind it, and writes the document a vendor sends a customer: what the requirement set
will take in **human delivery hours**, by work package and by role, as a range whose width is computed
from per-package confidence and whose every cost driver resolves to a record on disk. The canonical
shape of both artifacts — their section sets, the two identifier namespaces, the readiness tiers, the
confidence grades and the closed evidence set — is
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md`. This command executes that file; it never
restates it.

Usage: `/prd-proposal <ADDRESS> [--no-brief] [--profile] [--baseline <path>] [--redo]`

`<ADDRESS>` resolves through `workflows-core:addressing` §3 `resolve-address`, taken **after**
`$SPECS_PATH` is settled — a resolution taken before the variable is known returns `absent` for a
folder that exists, which is the ordering `/create-prd` and `/create-ard` state for the same reason.

**This command gates nothing downstream and nothing downstream waits on it.** It gates its own input
and nothing beyond it. No other command reads `proposal.md`, requires one to exist, or changes
behaviour because one does; running this is optional at every tier, in the same sense `/prd-ground`
is optional and ungated on the idea route. A proposal is a document a vendor sends a customer — not a
phase, not a prerequisite, and never a reason implementation cannot start.

**`/prd-proposal` is not BRD-route-only.** A `PRD-` folder is a `PRD-` folder. An idea-route PRD
carrying no `brd-link.md`, no `decisions.md` and no `grounding/` estimates fine — it grades at tier 1
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §5), and the document says outright that its
drivers are unknown.

**No money for human hours, at any tier, under any flag** — no rate, no currency symbol, no monetary
total, in either artifact or in the profile
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §1). The USD figures this run emits at the end
are model spend and are a different quantity.

**Both artifacts are prose, and prose is never hard-wrapped** — one unbroken line per paragraph,
per `workflows-core:prose-formatting`, so a straight copy-paste into a review tool or a message needs
no cleanup. This governs what the *run* writes; this command file itself stays wrapped like its
neighbours.

**There is no writer agent, and that is deliberate.** The proposal is authored inline by this command,
as `prd.md`, `ard.md` and `specification.md` are: the authoring *is* the command's purpose, and a
handoff to a writer would only add a place for the resolved data set to be lost between derivation and
rendering.

**This command takes no `--no-docs` and does no documentation grounding at all. That is a decision,
not an omission.** `docs-grounder` retrieves shipped product-documentation pages, which bear on how a
feature is described and not at all on what it costs to build. The inputs to an estimate are the
specs tree and the profile. There is no flag to turn off, no `resolve-docs-grounding` call, and no
`docs grounding:` line in this command's report.

## Phase 0 — Resolve the address, preflight, and gate the PRD

**Parse the flags before anything counts a positional token**, so a flag is never read as the address.
`--no-brief`, `--profile` and `--redo` are boolean; `--baseline` consumes the token after it. Strip
all four — and `--baseline`'s value with it — from `$ARGUMENTS` first; what remains is the single
positional `<ADDRESS>`. Without this rung the flags this command documents do not work: a flag is a
token, so `--redo` would arrive as the address and `--baseline <path>` would supply two.

1. **`$SPECS_PATH` (required).** If unset, stop naming `SPECS_PATH`, per the
   `Required path environment variable unset` rule in `workflows-core:escalation-rules`:
   `choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]`.

2. **Specs-repo preflight.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git specs-preflight")`
   and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline, as early as `$SPECS_PATH` is known and
   **before** the gate in step 5 — `require-on-main` performs no fetch of its own
   (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.2) and relies on this step's best-effort one. Prompt-free and
   silent when the specs repo is clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5
   notice; if it returns `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag for the whole run — the
   terminal `commit-artifacts` step skips on it.

3. **Resolve the address.** Resolve the single positional `<ADDRESS>` — a `<KEY>`, or an `@<path>`
   naming a folder — with `resolve-address` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3).
   A key that fails §1's grammar stops with
   `PRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_KEY: /prd-proposal needs an address (^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*(-\d+)+$, e.g. PRODUCT-1234 or the slice PRODUCT-1234-01) — re-run '/product-workflows:prd-proposal <ADDRESS>'.`
   Shape only, and never checked against anything (§1) — a key names a folder in `$SPECS_PATH`.
   `status: absent` stops with
   `PRD_PROPOSAL_NOT_FOUND: no folder found for <KEY> under $SPECS_PATH/specifications/ (every level addressing.md §3 bounds, plus §5's legacy fallback) — /prd-proposal prices an existing PRD folder and creates none.`
   This command creates no folder in the specs tree.

4. **Refuse a `BRD-` container**, structurally, **on the directory prefix, before any file inside the
   folder is read**. An effort proposal for a container is the umbrella rather than a slice's own
   estimate, and the two are different documents priced from different inputs.

   **The test is the directory prefix, never the folder's asserted `kind:`** — `/brd-split` writes
   `kind: brd` into the `brd-link.md` inside the `PRD-` slice folder it carves, so a slice *asserts*
   `brd` while being exactly the folder this command must accept; an asserted-kind gate would refuse
   every slice and accept nothing. Where the folder resolved through `workflows-core:addressing` §5's
   legacy unprefixed fallback there is no prefix to test: answer the question by the positive-evidence
   test in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1 — the shared authority
   the family's four other container refusals already cite, and not restated here.

   Enumerate the slices by `/brd-split` Phase 0's **positive test**: an immediate subdirectory
   carrying a `brd-link.md` whose `parent:` names this BRD. Stop:

   ```
   PRD_PROPOSAL_BRD_NOT_SLICED: <ADDRESS> resolves to a BRD- container at <path>, and an effort proposal for a container is the umbrella rather than a slice's own estimate.

     For the umbrella:            /product-workflows:brd-proposal <BRD-KEY>
     For each slice beneath it:   /product-workflows:prd-proposal <SLICE-KEY>   (one run per slice)

     Slices, by the positive test /brd-split Phase 0 uses — an immediate subdirectory carrying a brd-link.md whose parent: names this BRD:
     <enumerated slice keys, or "none — run /product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY> \"<how to cut it>\" to carve them">
   ```

5. **Gate `prd.md` on main.** Execute `require-on-main`
   (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff require-on-main")`, §3) against the
   PRD file in the resolved folder. **Resolve that file's actual name on the ref first**: `prd.md` on
   a current tree, a `<KEY>_*.md` entry only through `workflows-core:addressing` §5's legacy fallback.

   **Map `stopped` before `on_main`**, per §3's own rule: `on_main: absent` is returned by row F
   alone, and a caller that branches on `absent` first cannot tell row F from rows D/E. Any stopping
   row → stop per §4.4, naming the concrete branch and pull-request state it reports; `pass` →
   proceed; `pass_amending` → proceed, printing the §3.3 row-B message; `unmanaged` → proceed.

   **Row F splits into two stops on a test the gate cannot make**, exactly as `/prd-ground`'s
   idea-route row does — *never produced* and *produced, handoff declined* name different fixes. Test
   whether a PRD file is in the worktree at all:

   ```
   PRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_PRD: no prd.md on any ref for <KEY>, and none in <path> either — there is nothing to estimate yet.
     Author one first: /product-workflows:create-prd <KEY>
   ```

   ```
   PRD_PROPOSAL_PRD_NOT_HANDED_OFF: <path>/prd.md exists but is on no ref — it was written and its handoff was declined.
     Land the file that is already on disk; re-running /product-workflows:create-prd would author a second PRD rather than land this one.
   ```

**Nothing gates on `ard.md` or `specification.md`.** That is what grading replaces, and it is the
whole answer to the question of when a requirement set becomes estimable: Phase 3 grades what the
folder holds and caps confidence accordingly, and no tier withholds permission to begin work
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §5).

**`--baseline <path>` may sit outside `$SPECS_PATH`, and is read strictly read-only.** Nothing is
copied, committed or rewritten, and the reconciliation section cites it by the path the operator
gave. **An unreadable path is a stop naming that path**, never a silently omitted section:
`PRD_PROPOSAL_BASELINE_UNREADABLE: --baseline named <path>, which cannot be read. Give a readable path or drop the flag — a reconciliation section written against a baseline nobody can open is worse than none.`
Absent, §4's section 20 does not exist, is not a gap, and the document does not apologise for it.

**Note whether this run is a revision**, last: whether `proposal.md` and `proposal-brief.md` already
exist in the resolved folder. Where either does, Phase 6 treats the prior as the anchor (§8) unless
`--redo` was given, Phase 7 archives it (§2), and §4's section 21 renders (§12).

`/prd-proposal` is **cwd-agnostic**: it reads the resolved folder and the profile, and opens no code
repository at any point. Every commit any grounding finding cites was pinned by `/prd-ground`, and
this run reads the finding rather than the repository.

---

## Phase 1 — Classify + model routing

Invoke the `model-routing` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "workflows-core:model-routing"`), then record:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK   # SIGNIFICANT is the floor here; see the reason below
  reason: <one-line>
  current_model: <the model this orchestrator/grill is running under>
  detection_model: <§2.1 Sonnet chain: claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6/4-5>   # impl-maintenance
  review_model:    <§2 Opus chain>     # proposal-reviewer (frontmatter-pinned; recorded, no override)
  authoring_model: <= current_model>   # the profile grill + both artifacts (session model, not a delegated subagent)
  opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
  notes: <any §2/§2.1 fallback or degradation>
```

**`SIGNIFICANT` is the floor, and the reason is a property of the output rather than of the input
size.** This run produces a number a customer will make a commercial decision on, from evidence
spread across a register, a finding set and a folder tree, and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §13 states the residual risk plainly: a
plausible number with a defensible-looking argument is more dangerous than an obviously rough one.
Escalate to `HIGH-RISK` where the folder's own content warrants it — a contested register, a
reconciliation against a baseline the operator already believes is wrong.

**Tiered HARD model gate.** For `SIGNIFICANT` / `HIGH-RISK`, require an Opus session — if
`opus_available` is false, stop:
`choices: ["I'll relaunch /product-workflows:prd-proposal on Opus (Recommended)", "Override — proceed on the current model (logged in the final report)", "Cancel"]`.

---

## Phase 2 — The proposal profile

The profile is this command's only input that is not in the resolved folder. It lives at
`$SPECS_PATH/.dev-workflows/proposal-profile.yml`, borrowing the shape and the directory name
`/docs-workflows:docs-profile` established for `.dev-workflows/docs-profile.yml` but **not** its
location — that file lives in the docs repository because that is what writes it, and this one lives
in the specs repository for the same reason.

```yaml
vendor:
  name: ""                      # no default ships with the plugin
  footer_note: ""
client:
  name: ""
engagement_model: time-and-material   # or fixed-price
roles:
  - { id: tl, title: "Tech Lead / Architect", part_time: true }
  - { id: be, title: "Backend Engineer",       count: 2 }
  # ...the operator's own team shape; the plugin ships generic titles only
productivity:
  hours_per_developer_day: 8
  basis: ""                     # e.g. "two engineers working with AI assistants"
calendar:
  hours_per_week: 40
```

**How the profile is obtained, in three states:**

- **Absent** — grill it into existence (`workflows-core:grilling-technique`), field by field, and
  write it. `engagement_model` **restructures the engagement-governance, change-control and
  priced-options sections wholesale** (§4 sections 16 and 18), so it is asked rather than assumed:
  `choices: ["time-and-material", "fixed-price"]`.
- **Present** — **show it back for confirmation, every run, never read silently.** A productivity
  basis captured once and never revisited silently mis-scales every later proposal, which is the
  second of the two limits `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §13 states:
  `choices: ["Use it as shown (Recommended)", "Correct a field — I'll say which", "Re-grill the whole profile"]`.
- **`--profile`** — re-grill it in full regardless of what is on disk, then continue the run.

A run that cannot obtain a profile at all — the grill was cancelled, or the file cannot be written —
stops:
`PRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_PROFILE: no proposal profile at $SPECS_PATH/.dev-workflows/proposal-profile.yml, and none was captured. Re-run with --profile to author one; an effort proposal cannot state a team, a schedule or a productivity basis without it.`

**No rates, no currency, no money in this file** — the same rule that binds both artifacts
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §1). A profile carrying one is reported and
the value is not read.

---

## Phase 3 — Grade the readiness tier

Grade the resolved folder against `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §5, whose two
tables are the authority for what each tier changes and for the confidence ceiling it sets. Each row's
`+` is cumulative, so walk the ladder in order and stop at the first tier whose own condition the
folder does not meet:

1. **`prd.md`** — already established by Phase 0's gate. Tier **1 · Indicative**.
2. **Verified grounding, and a settled decision register.** Both conditions reuse rules that already
   exist and neither is re-expressed here: *verified grounding* is `workflows-core:grounding-format`'s
   rule that a finding carrying no verifier outcome is not evidence, applied to every finding in
   `grounding/code-grounding.md` and `grounding/design-grounding.md`; *a settled register* is the test
   `commands/brd-package.md` already applies to `decisions.md` and its `interview/round-<N>.md`
   records. Tier **2 · Grounded**.
3. **`ard.md` in the resolved folder.** Tier **3 · Architected**.
4. **`specification.md` in the resolved folder.** Tier **4 · Specified**.

**Print the tier, print what capped it, and continue.** The tier is **graded, never gated** — the
only hard refusal on readiness is the absent `prd.md` Phase 0 already performed. Print, beside it, the
highest grade any package may carry at this tier (§5's second table) and say that evidence can only
push a package lower, never higher.

**Two consequences the later phases execute rather than decide:** at tier 1 the document carries one
**document-level** re-estimate gate whose trigger is grounding the folder, rather than a per-package
commitment against triggers nobody has scheduled; and the brief does not render below tier 2
irrespective of `--no-brief` (Phase 8). Both are §5's, and both are stated to the operator here so the
shape of what they are about to receive is not a surprise at the end.

**An idea-route PRD caps at tier 1 today, and that is a truthful grade rather than a defect** (§5). A
tier-1 proposal is still a real document — scope, packages, team, schedule, a ranged number, every
assumption and dependency. What it does not carry is the argument for why the number is what it is,
and §4's section 4 says so outright.

---

## Phase 4 — Derive the work packages

Execute `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §7. Mint `[WP#n]` contiguously from the
resolved folder's requirement set (§3), and record for each package the seam that makes it
independently buildable, testable and acceptable — sections 9 and 17 of §4 both rest on that property,
so a package that cannot be accepted on its own makes both of them false.

1. **The two fixed packages** — a discovery-and-design package first and a test/UAT/release package
   last (§7).
2. **The middle packages.** Where `EPIC-` folders exist under the resolved folder they seed the
   clustering; where they do not, nothing is missing and the document says nothing about it. Epics are
   never required.
3. **The three-source defect sweep**, unioned (§7), because the obvious single source is necessary and
   nowhere near sufficient:
   - **`code-defect-log.md`** — every `[CDF#n]` not recorded as resolved. **No confirmation:** a
     standing `[CDF#n]` is a defect somebody already adjudicated
     (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-defect-log-format.md`).
   - **A verified grounding finding whose own text records a defect** rather than a capability.
     **Operator confirmation required.**
   - **An `[SR#n]` self-review finding** in the packaged bundle, where one exists, naming a code defect
     and not recorded as resolved. **Operator confirmation required.**

   Confirm sources 2 and 3 one candidate at a time, quoting the finding's own text and its
   `file:line`, because neither is a defect *register*: a finding may already be repaired, or may not
   be the vendor's to repair.
   `choices: ["Confirm — an unrepaired code defect this engagement would repair", "Reject — already repaired, or not the vendor's to repair"]`
   A confirmed defect from any source is identical downstream: same package, same exclusion from the
   lever table.
4. **The defect-remediation package.** Where the sweep confirmed anything, its repair is its own
   `[WP#n]`, created automatically. **It is never a scope lever** and renders into neither the
   scope-lever table nor the priced-options table (§7): asking a customer to authorise deferring a
   defect the vendor's own work found returns that deferral carrying the customer's authority on a
   question the vendor's policy has already answered. Where it cannot fit the delivery window, that is
   disclosed in §4's section 11 as a schedule fact, not tendered as an option.

Report the `[WP#n]` set, each with its seam, and name every defect candidate the operator rejected —
a rejection is a decision, and a reader of the final report is entitled to see which ones were taken.

---

## Phase 5 — Derive the cost drivers

**Compute and print the naive baseline first, at every tier** (§8): what the requirement would cost if
read at face value, with no correctness, completeness or enforcement obligation. It is the anchor that
makes the real number legible, and without it the driver table has no subject. It renders as §4's
section 3, before the drivers.

Then mint `[ED#n]` contiguously. **Every driver cites evidence from §8's closed set of three classes**,
each resolving to something on disk an independent reader can open — a verified grounding finding, a
frozen decision, or a confirmed code defect. §8 is the authority for the three and for what each one
may carry; do not re-express it.

- **A driver citing nothing from that set does not render at all.** The value of the rule is that it
  is mechanically checkable rather than a matter of authorial care, so check it mechanically: for each
  candidate driver, resolve its citation against the record it names before writing the row, and drop
  the row where it does not resolve. Report every dropped candidate by its intended subject, so a
  reader can tell a driver that was never written from one that was never thought of.
- **The narrowing is per-driver, not global** (§8): a driver making a claim about **the code** cites
  class 1, because a decision cannot evidence a statement about a repository. Restricting the whole
  set to grounding was the first draft of that rule and it was wrong — the driver class that is *scope
  the customer added after the baseline* is evidenced by the register and by nothing else.
- **At tier 1 the section states outright that the drivers are not known** (§4 section 4, §5). It is
  not an empty table and it is not an apology: it is the one honest thing a tier-1 document can say
  about why its number is what it is.

**The open-items sweep runs here too, and its output is derived rather than authored** (§8). Open
assumption records, unanswered customer questions from the interview round, and any code defect
recorded as blocking render into §4's section 13 and into the brief's *what is needed before week 1*
list (§10 row 5) — so a question raised of the customer and not yet answered cannot vanish between the
review package and the proposal.

---

## Phase 6 — Hours, confidence and the range

1. **Hours per package and role** (§8) — derived from the requirement count and kind inside the
   package, the drivers touching it, and the profile's `productivity.basis` and
   `hours_per_developer_day`. The output is §4's section 6: a **`[WP#n]` × role grid carrying an
   Expected, a Low and a High total column per package, plus a totals row and a totals column** — the
   shape the reviewer's arithmetic check reconciles in both directions, so it is rendered even where a
   role contributes zero to a package.
2. **QA effort** is sized from the authored test-case count at tier 4 and from a stated ratio below
   it, **and the document says which of the two it used** (§8) — a ratio silently replaced by a count
   is a change of basis a reader is entitled to see.
3. **Confidence, per package, with a stated reason** (§6), capped by the tier Phase 3 printed. The
   band about the expected figure is §6's default for the grade; the low and high figures describe a
   **credible range rather than best and worst cases**, and the document says so in as many words.
4. **Any deviation from the default band — in either direction — carries a stated reason in the
   confidence section** (§6). Widening and narrowing are treated alike. §6 owns the two severities and
   the one-percentage-point tolerance the reviewer applies to them; this phase's job is to compute the
   default, record the deviation, and record its reason.
5. **A package graded Low carries a declared re-estimate gate naming its trigger event** — a profiling
   result, an arriving decision, a load measurement (§8), rendered as §4's section 8. Declaring the
   gate is mandatory at Low; **the no-hours commitment is not**, and it belongs to a particular gate
   rather than to the grade (§8). Offer it per gate, never by default:
   `choices: ["Declare the gate only — a re-estimate promise", "Add the no-implementation-hours-before-the-gate commitment"]`
6. **The stability rule, which is what makes a re-run safe** (§8). A re-run always re-derives its
   inputs, but the prior revision is an **anchor**: a package's expected hours carry forward unchanged
   unless something feeding them changed, and where a figure moves, §12's changelog names the cause. A
   figure that moved with no cited cause is a defect. **`--redo` discards the anchor deliberately**,
   for when the prior estimate is known to be wrong — say so in the report when it was given, because
   a run that discarded the anchor and a run that had none are indistinguishable in the output
   otherwise.

**No money for human hours, at any tier, under any flag** (§1). Every figure this phase produces is
hours.

---

## Phase 7 — Author `proposal.md`

Write `<folder>/proposal.md` — `<folder>` being the resolved folder itself, so §4's section 19
traceability is relative links that resolve rather than names a reader must go and find (§2).

**Archive the predecessor before overwriting it** (§2), following the canonical-plus-archived
convention `commands/update-prd.md` Phase 5 establishes: the prior `proposal.md` moves to
`<folder>/revisions/<KEY>_proposal_<YYYYMMDD>.md`, a second revision on the same day taking the suffix
`-2`, `-3`, and so on. The new canonical records `revision_of:` naming the archived snapshot.

**Render §4's twenty-one-row section set, in its order.** Two sections are conditional — section 20
renders only under `--baseline`, section 21 only on a revision (§12) — and **every other section
renders at every tier, a section with nothing to say saying so rather than being omitted**. The header
block carries the readiness tier beside the date, so a reader is never handed a number without being
told what grade of evidence stands behind it (§2), and it carries the `engagement_model` from the
profile.

Three things the section list makes easy to get wrong, each stated because §4 names them and this run
executes them:

- **Section 15 is not section 18.** *What the range does not cover* is the set of conditions the band
  was computed under (§9); *exclusions from scope* is what is not being built. Conflating them is how
  a reader concludes the high figure is a ceiling. They are two sections for that reason.
- **Section 11's indicative schedule carries peak concurrency, never a sum of FTEs** (§4).
- **Section 19 cites a requirement in the form the source artifact carries it** (§11), because a
  proposal is read by the **customer**, who wrote those identifiers in their own document in their own
  form. The `[WP#n]` and `[ED#n]` namespaces this run mints are the plugin's own and stay bracketed. A
  conversion in either direction is the defect the reviewer looks for.

Write the whole file as prose that is never hard-wrapped (`workflows-core:prose-formatting`).

---

## Phase 8 — Author `proposal-brief.md`

**Skipped below tier 2, irrespective of `--no-brief`** (§5): the brief's spine is the driver argument,
and below tier 2 that spine does not exist. A two-page pre-read explaining why a number is large,
written when the reasons are unknown, is the one artifact this format must not produce. Skipped as well
at tier ≥ 2 where `--no-brief` was given. **Say which of the two reasons applied**, in the report — a
brief withheld by the tier and a brief withheld by the flag are different facts about the run.

Otherwise write `<folder>/proposal-brief.md` from **the same resolved data set as the proposal, never
re-authored from it**, rendering §10's six-row section set. **A spine-only brief is a defect, not a
shorter brief** (§10): every item in rows 2–6 that the proposal carries reaches the brief, and every
figure the brief repeats matches the proposal.

**Archive the prior brief only where this run renders one** (§2) — the prior `proposal-brief.md` moves
to `<folder>/revisions/<KEY>_proposal-brief_<YYYYMMDD>.md` under §2's same-day suffix rule.
Archiving is tied to overwriting, so a run that renders no brief archives none. Where a prior brief is
therefore left standing beside a newly written proposal, **say so plainly in the final report**: that
file describes the archived revision and not this one.

---

## Phase 9 — Pre-lint, review and triage

**The cheap pass runs before the expensive one.**

1. **Structural pre-lint.** Run the deterministic checks in
   `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "pre-lint")` against both artifacts this run wrote:
   its **Universal checks**, **identifier integrity** over the `[WP#n]` and `[ED#n]` series, and
   **required-section presence** against §4's and §10's section sets. **Its *Auto-link collision*
   check does not run here**, that section being scoped to PRD, ARD and Epic files, and
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §11 records why the exclusion is deliberate
   rather than an oversight to be corrected. There is no artifact-specific pre-lint block for a
   proposal; §4 and §10 are what required-section presence is checked against. Advisory — surface
   every finding, inline-fix the mechanical ones, and proceed; the reviewer is the gate.
2. **The review gate.** Dispatch `proposal-reviewer` (Opus, frontmatter-pinned; recorded as
   `review_model`, no override):

   → Agent (subagent_type: "product-workflows:proposal-reviewer", model: `<review_model — §2 Opus chain>`):
     > "Review the effort proposal:
     >
     > Proposal path: [absolute path to proposal.md]
     > Brief path: [absolute path to proposal-brief.md, or 'none — <the reason Phase 8 recorded>']
     > Profile path: [absolute path to proposal-profile.yml]
     > Readiness tier: [1 · Indicative | 2 · Grounded | 3 · Architected | 4 · Specified], capped by [what capped it]
     > Anchor revision: [absolute path to the archived prior revision, or 'none — first revision' or 'discarded by --redo']"

3. **Triage before anything is edited.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "finding-triage")`
   and follow it over the reviewer's findings — **the orchestrator runs the triage, never a fixer**.
   Verify each finding's claimed consequence at the location it names, keep or dismiss it, and record
   every dismissal with a reason that disposes of that finding's own claim. There is no silent-drop
   disposition. Fix the surviving BLOCKERs inline (the orchestrator edits both artifacts — there is no
   delegated writer) and re-review **once**; if still `BLOCK`, escalate per the
   `Review verdict BLOCK` rule in
   `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "escalation-rules")`.
   `PASS` / `PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS` → proceed. Cap: one fix cycle plus one re-review. Where triage
   empties the survivor set, do not dispatch a fix cycle with nothing to apply and do not silently
   promote the verdict — the user settles a verdict its own findings no longer support.

Report findings reviewed, survivors, and every dismissal with its reason: a triage that reports only
survivors is indistinguishable from a reviewer that found less.

## Phase 10 — Handoff

Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff")` and present its §4.3 choice array verbatim:

```
choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git (the next phase will stop until this is on main)", "Cancel"]
```

**The array above is §4.3's `gated` one, selected by §4.0's test and named here rather than left to be
inferred.** `/product-workflows:brd-proposal` runs `require-on-main` against the `proposal.md` this run
writes, so the artifact carries a §3.4 row and declining the handoff costs that command its start.
`proposal-brief.md` and the archived revisions travel in the same `deliverable_paths` set and take that
path's class with them (§4.0).

On the first choice, execute `handoff-to-main` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff handoff-to-main")`, §2) with `prefix: prd`
(§2.9's table — the proposal opens on the shared `prd` prefix rather than a ninth of its own; the eight
prefixes §1 rule 3 fixes are not extended, and nothing about a proposal makes it a ninth phase),
`feature_folder` as resolved in Phase 0, `deliverable_paths` = `proposal.md`, `proposal-brief.md` where
this run rendered one, and, on a revision, the archived prior under `revisions/` —
`<KEY>_proposal_<YYYYMMDD>.md`, and `<KEY>_proposal-brief_<YYYYMMDD>.md` where a brief was archived
beside it, `title: <KEY> Effort proposal <YYYYMMDD>`, and `body_facts` = the readiness tier and what
capped it; the `[WP#n]` count and the total expected hours with its range; the count of packages graded
Low and how many carry a declared re-estimate gate; the `proposal-reviewer` verdict; and whether a
rationale brief was rendered. Emit its §4.1 outcome line in the final report.

---

## Phase 11 — Next steps

**Three literal arrays, one per tier branch.** Every printed command name is fully qualified
(`workflows-core:next-phase-offer` rule 6), and each array prints exactly one positional address
(rule 7).

```
choices: ["Stop here — the proposal is written and, if you handed it off, committed", "Roll it into the programme umbrella — /product-workflows:brd-proposal <BRD-KEY> <merge-clause>", "Price the next sibling slice — /product-workflows:prd-proposal <SIBLING-SLICE-KEY>", "Re-derive it from scratch once the inputs move — /product-workflows:prd-proposal <KEY> --redo"]
```

```
choices: ["Stop here — the proposal is written and, if you handed it off, committed", "Roll it into the programme umbrella — /product-workflows:brd-proposal <BRD-KEY> <merge-clause>", "Raise the tier first — /product-workflows:create-ard <KEY>, then re-run this command to narrow the range", "Price the next sibling slice — /product-workflows:prd-proposal <SIBLING-SLICE-KEY>"]
```

```
choices: ["Stop here — the proposal is written and, if you handed it off, committed", "Roll it into the programme umbrella — /product-workflows:brd-proposal <BRD-KEY> <merge-clause>", "Raise the tier first — /product-workflows:specify <KEY>, then re-run this command to narrow the range", "Price the next sibling slice — /product-workflows:prd-proposal <SIBLING-SLICE-KEY>"]
```

The **first** array is presented at tier 1 and at tier 4 — at tier 1 because nothing available raises
the tier from a `PRD-` folder alone, at tier 4 because there is no tier above it. The **second** is
presented at tier 2 and the **third** at tier 3: those are the two runs where a named command actually
moves the grade, and telling the operator the document they just received is improvable is worth more
than a forward pointer.

**Drop an option whose subject does not exist on this run** — the umbrella option where the folder has
no parent BRD, the sibling option where no sibling holds a stale proposal or none exists. **Where
dropping would leave fewer than two options, add** `"Re-derive it from scratch once the inputs move —
/product-workflows:prd-proposal <KEY> --redo"`, which is available on every run, so the array never
falls below the two options `AskUserQuestion` requires. Nothing is ever added beyond that, and no
option's wording is adjusted: `<merge-clause>`, `<BRD-KEY>`, `<KEY>` and `<SIBLING-SLICE-KEY>` are
substitutions, not rewordings (`workflows-core:escalation-rules`, *Choice lists are presented
verbatim*).

**`<merge-clause>` is resolved from the `Phase handoff:` line this run actually emitted**, per
`workflows-core:next-phase-offer`'s resolution table — only two of its rows name a branch, and a
declined handoff opened no pull request. `/product-workflows:brd-proposal` runs `require-on-main`
against the `proposal.md` this run has just written, which is why that one option carries the
placeholder and the two tier-raising options do not: both of those gate on `prd.md`, which this run
does not write.

Guidance only — never auto-invokes another command. Per `workflows-core:next-phase-offer`.

### Context hygiene

The resume pointer is written in the terminal cost phase (Phase 12), per
`workflows-core:session-hygiene` §1 — this block prints the guidance only.

- **Re-pricing the same slice after a correction?** → run **`/compact`**; the resolved data set is
  still worth keeping.
- **Moving to another slice, or to the umbrella?** → run **`/clear`**; both artifacts are on disk and
  the next run reads them from the specs repo, not from this session.
- Consider **`/rename <KEY>-<slug>-pm`** so you can find this session later.

Guidance only — see `workflows-core:session-hygiene`.

---

## Phase 12 — Session maintenance, feedback & cost

Terminal phase — runs after Phase 11, and NEVER interrupts an earlier phase. The order below is the
canonical emitter tail (`workflows-core:session-hygiene` §5 rule 2): feedback → follow-ups → cost →
`resume.md` → `commit-artifacts`.

**Capture-at-block invariant.** If an EARLIER phase halts on a plugin / skill / command / reference
gap, `emit-block` (per `workflows-core:feedback-emission`) fires at that halt **before** escalating.
**None of this command's own stops qualifies**, and that is the point of naming them here:
`PRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_KEY`, `PRD_PROPOSAL_NOT_FOUND`, `PRD_PROPOSAL_BRD_NOT_SLICED`,
`PRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_PRD`, `PRD_PROPOSAL_PRD_NOT_HANDED_OFF`, `PRD_PROPOSAL_BASELINE_UNREADABLE`,
`PRD_PROPOSAL_NEEDS_PROFILE` and an unset `$SPECS_PATH` each report the state of the operator's own
argument list, tree or environment — not a capability this plugin lacks. A review BLOCK is not one
either: that is the gate working.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (subagent_type: "workflows-core:impl-maintenance", model:
   `<detection_model — §2.1 Sonnet chain>`) with a compact handoff: command `/prd-proposal`; what was
   produced (the proposal, the brief or the reason there is none, the archived prior); key events (the
   tier and what capped it, defect candidates confirmed and rejected, drivers dropped for want of
   evidence, band deviations and their reasons, BLOCK reviews — or 'none'); workarounds; the
   `proposal-reviewer` verdict; test result N/A; project root = the resolved folder.
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "feedback-emission emit-auto")`
   and call its `emit-auto` entry point (§6) with the report, `command: /prd-proposal`, the run's
   `key`, `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`).
   Surface the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted").
3. **Emit follow-up tasks.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "followup-emission")`
   and execute its steps inline over this run's qualifying follow-ups — the open items §8's sweep
   surfaced (Phase 5) and every candidate driver dropped for want of a citation, each of which is
   work somebody has to do outside this run. Filter with the reference's §6 predicate, resolve the
   write target via its §4 ladder, dedupe per §5, and preview + confirm per §7. ADDITIVE: the same
   items also stay in the final report.
4. **Session cost (ALWAYS runs).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "cost-emission emit-cost")` and call its `emit-cost` entry point with `command: /prd-proposal`, `phase: proposal`, `role: pm`, the run's `key`, `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Surface the persisted path (or the report-only notice). **This entry records model spend in USD and has no relationship whatever to the human hours the artifacts contain.**
5. **Write the resume pointer.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "session-hygiene")`
   and, per its §1, write/overwrite `<PRD-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` now — after the cost entry
   above, so the pointer reflects the completed run, and before the commit step below, so it is
   included in it. Redact per §1. Silent; the printed `### Context hygiene` guidance already appeared.
6. **Commit session artifacts (terminal).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git commit-artifacts")`
   and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — the LAST action of the run. It stages
   ONLY the §2.1 bounded artifact paths inside `$SPECS_PATH`, commits
   `<KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (/prd-proposal)` with no `Co-Authored-By` trailer, and
   pushes to the branch this run's handoff phase created (§4.1). It NEVER touches anything outside
   `$SPECS_PATH`; NEVER force-pushes; NEVER fails the run; and skips entirely when the run carries
   `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting that notice. Hold its §6 outcome line for the final
   report.

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits the deliverable (git for the deliverable is
offered only in Phase 10; the terminal step above commits only the bounded session-artifact paths in
`$SPECS_PATH`), and NEVER writes into a code repo, a docs repo, or the current working directory; no
user name is ever written.

## Final report

Report: the resolved folder and the `PRD-` key; **the readiness tier and what capped it**, with the
confidence ceiling that tier sets; the PRD gate's return value; the `[WP#n]` set with each package's
seam and confidence grade, and **the totals row of §4's section 6 — expected hours with its low and
high** (hours, never money); the count of packages graded Low and how many carry a declared
re-estimate gate, and which of those gates the operator attached the no-implementation-hours
commitment to; the `[ED#n]` count by evidence class, and **every candidate driver dropped for want of
a citation, by its intended subject** — so an empty driver table can be told from an unrun derivation;
every band that deviates from §6's default for its grade, with the direction and the recorded reason;
which QA sizing basis was used (authored test-case count, or a stated ratio); every defect candidate
confirmed and every one rejected, by source; whether a naive baseline was computed (it always is) and
what it came to; **whether a rationale brief was rendered and, when it was not, which of the two
reasons applied** — the tier, or `--no-brief` — and, where a prior brief is left standing beside a
newly written proposal, that it describes the archived revision and not this one; whether this run was
a revision, the archived paths, and whether `--redo` discarded the anchor; the `--baseline` path where
one was given, cited as the operator gave it; the profile's `engagement_model` and whether the profile
was read back, corrected or re-grilled; the pre-lint findings; the `proposal-reviewer` verdict with
the triage line — findings reviewed, survivors, and every dismissal with its reason; resolved model
routing (+ any Opus gate or degradation); the feedback, follow-up and cost paths, with the cost line
labelled as **model spend in USD, a different quantity from the hours above**; the
`Phase handoff:` outcome line from `handoff-to-main` (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.1); the
`Specs repo:` outcome line from `commit-artifacts` (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §6), with any
guard notice repeated in full; and the next-step recommendation.

**Say plainly, at the end, that this document gates nothing.** No command reads a proposal, no tier
withholds permission to begin work, and nothing downstream is waiting on this run — the residual risk
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/proposal-format.md` §13 states is carried by the person who sends
the document, and that person is the reader of this report.
