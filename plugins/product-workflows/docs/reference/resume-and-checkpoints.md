# Resume and checkpoints

A long-running command ends by doing two separate things: it flushes a small pointer file to disk recording exactly where things stand, then it suggests — never performs — the right context action for what comes next, `/compact`, `/clear`, or a session `/rename`. Both are guidance only; the plugin never invokes any of those three itself. The point is to stop relying on you to remember to ask "am I ready to compact or clear" — the pipeline does the disk-flush itself and hands you the choice already framed. The mechanism itself is shared across the whole family; this page describes what `product-workflows`'s own fourteen commands do with it.

## What `resume.md` is for

`resume.md` exists so you can pick a run back up in a fresh session without re-deriving what the last one already established — what command ran last, what it produced, and what to run next — instead of scrolling back through a compacted or cleared transcript, or worse, re-reading every artifact from scratch to reconstruct where you left off. It is a **"last known position" pointer, overwritten every run, not an append log** — there is exactly one current answer to "where am I," not a history of every past one. It stays intentionally tiny:

```markdown
# Resume — <KEY>[ / <EPIC-KEY>] (<role>)

- **Last completed:** <command> <args> — <phase or 'command complete'> (<ISO datetime>)
- **Artifact:** <relative path to the deliverable just written/committed, or 'none (read-only)'>
- **Next step:** <the exact next command from ### Next step, or 'PRD fully processed'>
- **Suggested session name:** <KEY>-<slug>-<role>   (omit this line on a run whose own `### Context hygiene` block carries no `/rename` suggestion — e.g. /create-prd, which writes the file and omits the line for its phase length and not for want of a key: it takes one as a mandatory argument)
- **Carry-forward decisions:** <0–N one-line decisions the next phase needs that are NOT already in the artifact; 'none' if none>
```

Any secret, credential, token, or other sensitive value that might otherwise land in the `Carry-forward decisions` line is redacted before writing — a resume pointer records what to do next, never a value worth protecting.

**When it's written.** The write is unconditional for any PRD-scoped run, and it happens first — before the terminal `commit-artifacts` step, but only after the deliverable artifact is already saved or committed, and after the feedback, follow-ups and cost phases have all run. The canonical terminal order is deliverable and handoff, then feedback, then follow-ups, then cost, then `resume.md`, then `commit-artifacts`. Whether the suggestion (below) actually fires or not, the write itself always happens — **prepare always, suggest adaptively.**

**Where it lands.** Three tiers, walked in order: `$SPECS_PATH` writable with the PRD directory matched → `<PRD-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` — a fixed, family-wide folder name shared with the cost and feedback files described elsewhere in this reference section, not a `product-workflows`-specific path — the primary case; `$SPECS_PATH` writable but **no PRD directory matched** → the file is skipped outright and the run relies on the printed `### Next step` instead; and `$SPECS_PATH` not writable → skipped, with a one-line warning that no resume pointer could be persisted and you should set it.

**Which runs skip it entirely.** `/idea` does resolve a PRD folder, but its brief is handed off in the same run rather than resumed later, so a pointer would only go stale.

## The suggestion: `/compact` or `/clear`

Every next-step option a command offers already carries a role label — see [Roles and phases](../roles-and-phases.md) for what PM, PA, and PE each own. The context-hygiene suggestion reads those same labels rather than hardcoding a per-command verdict:

- **Staying in the same role** for the next step (`/create-prd` → PM `/update-prd`, or `/brd-intake` → `/brd-split`, both PM) → **`/compact`** — the context is still relevant, so keep the thread going.
- **Moving to a different role** (`/epics` PE → `/create-ard` PA, or `/create-prd` PM → the companion plugin's `/dev-workflows:design` Dev) → **`/clear`** is the better default when one person is wearing both hats, since the prior role's reasoning becomes noise for the next one; `/compact` still works fine if you're continuing right away yourself.
- **The next step could go either way** (`/create-prd` → PM `/docs-workflows:release-notes`, or handing off to PA/PE) → both branches are named explicitly: continuing as the same role suggests `/compact`, handing off — even to yourself — suggests `/clear`.
- **You're done, or ending the session** → no suggestion at all.

`/prd-ground` is the one command on this route with a role transition inside its own name — PM-initiated, PA/Dev-executed — but the suggestion follows what the *next* command's role is, not this one's, exactly as every other transition does.

## The `/rename` aid

The commands that print a suggested `/rename <KEY>-<slug>-<role>` line are the PA/PE/Dev ladder — `/create-ard`, `/epics`, `/specify` here, and the companion plugins' `/dev-workflows:design`, `/dev-workflows:ready`, `/dev-workflows:implement`, `/docs-workflows:document`, and `/docs-workflows:release-notes` — plus this plugin's two PM effort-proposal commands, `/prd-proposal` and `/brd-proposal`, whose suggested name is keyed on the folder they priced. The line lets you find this session again later in `claude --resume` by name instead of by scrolling. `<KEY>` is the key that named the folder the run resolved — a PRD key on the ladder, the root BRD key for `/brd-proposal` — and `<role>` is the lane tag of the command that just finished: pm, pa, or pe here. **That set is not "every command that takes a `<PRD>` or `<EPIC>`"**: `/dev-workflows:implement` in direct mode takes no address and `/docs-workflows:document` in doc-edit mode takes none either, and neither of those modes writes a pointer at all. `/idea` and `/create-prd` are excluded, and the reason is the phase rather than the key: each takes a mandatory key as its first argument and refuses without one, so a PM run always has a key it could name the session after — but the ideation phase is short enough that naming the session isn't worth automatically suggesting. `/update-prd` and every command of the BRD-to-PRD route print none either, `/brd-reconcile` included: a BRD key exists from the first command, so this is never a want of a key, and no route command states a reason of its own — the resume pointer's omit-condition reads each run's own context-hygiene block rather than a list, so none is needed.

## Mid-phase checkpoints

None of `product-workflows`'s fourteen commands is long enough to carry its own mid-phase checkpoint the way the companion plugin's `/dev-workflows:implement` does — each authoring or grounding run finishes in one pass and reaches the end-of-run write described above.

## The contract

Five rules bound everything above: it is **guidance-only** — `/compact`, `/clear`, and `/rename` are always suggested, never invoked by the plugin itself; the disk flush is **prepare-first** — unconditional for a PRD-scoped run and always ahead of the suggestion it accompanies, so acting on the printed suggestion is always safe; the compact-versus-clear split is **role-aware through a single graph**, reading role labels from the next-step offer rather than duplicating that graph here; the whole mechanism is **mode-aware**, degrading to a plain optional `/compact` note (or nothing at all) on a run that writes no pointer — for one of two reasons: either there is no PRD anchor to write one against, or there is one and the run is not a phase a later run resumes, which is `/idea`'s case; and it **never blocks** — the guidance is a nudge appended to the end of the Final Report, exactly like the next-phase offer it sits beside.

The full mechanics — the exact `resume.md` write procedure, the redaction rule, and the `### Context hygiene` block's own shape — live in `workflows-core:session-hygiene`, which this page describes from `product-workflows`'s side rather than restates.
