name: brd-package
description: BRD customer-package workflow (PM phase, the BRD-to-PRD route's customer-packaging step, run once per slice after its own `/brd-interview` round settles). Gates on the BRD's decisions being merged and on every interview question carrying a terminal disposition or the held-for-the-customer holding state, then runs an adversarial self-review through brd-package-reviewer and refuses to build a bundle while any [SR#n] is undisposed. Renders a self-contained customer prompt in the fixed eleven-part order with the customer-review schema inlined from section 2 onward at build time, surfaces every open [AS#n] and every accepted-risk [SR#n] under "where to attack us hardest" and every not-yet-customer-reviewed prerequisite under "what could still move", renders a delivery note under a 200-word ceiling, and assembles a de-Obsidianised bundle of plain markdown plus images with any dependency package copied in and marked not for re-review. Assigns the degradation tier from what was shippable, scans the rendered prompt for anything plugin-internal, and emits the repo-to-SHA table. Takes no --no-docs and does no documentation grounding.

Turn the decided BRD into a package a customer can actually review: $ARGUMENTS

**Core references.** A citation of the form `workflows-core:<name>` names a shared reference in the `workflows-core` plugin. Load it with `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "<name>")` — never by path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to this plugin, which does not carry it.

`/brd-package` is the **BRD-to-PRD route's customer-packaging step** (PM phase) — it takes the register
`/brd-interview` wrote and the `[C]` questions it held, attacks the package before the customer
does, and renders a bundle for a reviewer with **a vanilla agent and nothing installed**. Its whole
discipline is one rule: **everything this command emits is read by somebody outside the delivery
organisation who cannot ask what a path means**
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §1, D12). This command exists to make that
happen, not to restate it.

Usage: `/brd-package <BRD-KEY> [--depends-on <BRD-KEY>…]`

`<BRD-KEY>` still resolves through `resolve-address`, which searches every level
`workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds — three below `specifications/` — and so returns a BRD that owns
its source document, one of its slices, an idea-route PRD folder or an Epic folder alike, because a
root must be resolved before Phase 0 step 5a can refuse it by name. **Only a slice is
packaged: a root BRD is refused, and packaging happens at the slice and nowhere else** — a slice
holds its own register, its own `[C]` question set and its own findings, and it is packaged from
those and no others. The bundle this run builds is the bundle of the BRD it was given.

**Standing rule, binding on every phase below.** Nothing that names this plugin, this repository or
this harness may appear in the rendered prompt, the delivery note, or any document inside the
bundle. Not a path rooted at the plugin's install directory, not a `references/…` citation, not a
slash command, not an agent or skill name, not a `§` section reference
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/customer-review-schema.md` §1). The section *How nothing
plugin-internal reaches the customer* below states the ordering and the scan that make that
structural rather than aspirational.

**This command takes no `--no-docs`, and it does no documentation grounding at all. That is a
decision, not an omission.** `/brd-intake` and `/prd-ground` already ground this BRD against the
shipped product documentation when `$DOCS_PATH` resolves (D22,
`workflows-core:docs-grounding`), and `/brd-interview` deliberately does none
for the same reason this command does none: it works on **decisions already taken**. This command
goes one step further — it establishes no claim of its own at all. It renders what other commands
recorded, and a documentation page cannot change a decision that is already in the register or a
finding that is already verified; consulting one here could only introduce an ungrounded sentence
into a bundle whose whole value is that every sentence in it is traceable. So there is no flag to
turn off, no `resolve-docs-grounding` call, and no `docs grounding:` line in this command's report.
The sentence is written here because leaving it unwritten is exactly how the gap it forecloses gets
shipped.

**No repository is opened, at any point.** Every commit this package cites was pinned and proven
clean by `/prd-ground`, and the repo→SHA table is read from that run's `grounding/baselines.md`. So
there is no baseline gate here, no dirty-tree stop, and no `$REPOS_PATH` requirement. The three
`baseline-integrity` commands are not re-run by this command — they are **handed to the customer's
reviewer**, written out with the repository and the commit substituted, so the customer re-derives
the pin against their own checkout rather than taking the package's word for it
(`workflows-core:grounding-format` §4).

## How nothing plugin-internal reaches the customer

Five properties, and every one of them is a property of the **order and the inputs of the phases
below**, not an instruction to be careful. Together they are the guarantee; individually none of
them is.

1. **The schema is rendered from its own file, from the boundary that file declares, and never in
   full.** `customer-review-schema.md` separates a preamble addressed to the delivery team from a
   body addressed to the customer, and states where the boundary falls. The *Render the customer
   prompt* phase reads the boundary statement out of the file before it renders, and stops if it is
   no longer there. Rendering the whole file would put that file's own `references/…` citations in
   front of a reader with no plugin — the exact failure D12 exists to prevent — and the citations
   are collected in the preamble precisely so that the boundary has something to protect.

2. **The prompt is assembled, never hand-written.** Every one of its eleven parts is filled from a
   named artifact — the register, the findings, the ledger, the `[C]` question set, the self-review,
   `baselines.md`, `brd-link.md`. A part with no source is an empty part that says so, not a part
   somebody writes from memory. Prose written fresh into a customer prompt is prose nothing
   verified, and it is where an in-house reference gets explained rather than removed.

3. **The de-Obsidianising pass renders a copy and never edits a source.** The bundle is produced on
   the way out; the working documents keep their wikilinks (`bundle-packaging.md` §2). A pass that
   edits the source is a data-loss bug wearing a formatting fix, and it also destroys the only clean
   copy from which a later package could be rendered correctly.

4. **The plugin-free scan runs over the finished text, not over the templates.** It is the last
   thing the *Render the customer prompt* phase does; in *Render the delivery note* nothing follows
   it but the instruction to print the finished note; and in *Assemble the bundle* it is the last
   thing rule 7 does, immediately followed by rule 8's citation-resolution check
   (`bundle-packaging.md` §6) as that phase's own last pass. It inspects what will actually be sent,
   wherever it sits: a scan over the templates would pass on a prompt whose leak arrived through an
   interpolated document title.

5. **A scan hit stops the run; it never sanitises.** The command does not strip the offending token
   and continue. A citation that reached the prompt reached it because some part of the package
   assumed a reader who has this plugin, and deleting the four characters that reveal that leaves
   the assumption in place and the sentence unfollowable. What is reported is the token, the part it
   landed in, and the artifact it came from. **The one exception is the customer's own words and
   naming** — verbatim customer content and customer-derived locators, both as
   `bundle-packaging.md` §6.3 defines them — where the customer's own token is reported and put to
   the operator, who ships it as the customer's own or holds the package, which stops the run with
   `BRD_PACKAGE_CUSTOMER_CONTENT_HELD`; or, where that section says so, it is not a hit at all.
   Either way the hit itself never stops the run outright (*The plugin-free scan*, below).

The failure all five exist to prevent is stated once, in `bundle-packaging.md` §1, and is not
restated here: a bundle that assumes anything about the machine it lands on is a bundle the customer
cannot review, and they will not tell you that — they will review it anyway, badly.

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve inputs and gate the decided BRD

1. **`<BRD-KEY>` (mandatory).** Parse the first token that is neither a flag nor a flag's value — `--depends-on` consumes the token after it (step 2), and a value skipped as "non-flag" would be read as the key; validate with `key-valid`
   (`workflows-core:addressing` §1). If absent or invalid, stop:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_NEEDS_KEY: /brd-package needs a BRD key (shape ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*(-\d+)+$) — re-run '/product-workflows:brd-package <KEY>'.`
2. **`--depends-on <BRD-KEY>`.** Repeatable, each consuming the next token; validate each with
   `key-valid` and drop (warn, do not stop the run) any that fail shape — the same handling
   `/prd-ground` Phase 0 gives the same flag, because the flag means the same thing here and a
   mistyped prerequisite must not cost the operator the whole run. Any key at any level is
   admissible as the value (D17), so a slice depending on a source-owning BRD and a slice depending
   on a sibling express identically; the declarer is always a slice, since this command refuses a
   root. What the flag then does is the *Resolve prerequisites and their packages* phase's
   business.
3. **`$SPECS_PATH` (required).** If unset, stop naming `SPECS_PATH`, per the
   `Required path environment variable unset` rule in
   `workflows-core:escalation-rules`:
   ```
   choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]
   ```
4. **Specs-repo preflight.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git specs-preflight")` and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline, **before** the gate below — `require-on-main`
   performs no fetch of its own (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.2) and relies on this step's best-effort one,
   the same ordering `/brd-interview` uses and for the same reason. Prompt-free and silent when the
   specs repo is clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5 notice; if it returns
   `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag for the whole run.
5. **Resolve the BRD folder.** `resolve-address <BRD-KEY>` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3), which searches
   every level `workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds — three below `specifications/`, plus §5's legacy fallback — and so can return any folder kind it finds there: a `BRD-` folder directly under `specifications/`, a `PRD-` folder (a slice inside a BRD, or an idea-route PRD folder), or an `EPIC-` folder inside a `PRD-` folder. Step 5a answers the level question on what it returns. Absent
   → stop, without asserting which command would have created it:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_NOT_FOUND: no folder found for <BRD-KEY> under $SPECS_PATH/specifications/ (every level addressing.md §3 bounds, plus §5's legacy fallback) — check the key. A BRD with a source document of its own is created by /product-workflows:brd-intake <BRD-KEY> @<brd-file>; a slice is created by /product-workflows:brd-split on its parent.`
5a. **The root and Epic refusals — packaging happens at the slice and nowhere else.** Take this the moment
    step 5 returns a resolved folder, before step 6 opens anything — the level question is answered
    before any gate that follows it. Test the **resolved directory's prefix**: `BRD-` is a root,
    `EPIC-` an Epic folder, `PRD-` a slice or an idea-route PRD folder, which step 5b tells apart — the kind-prefix convention `workflows-core:addressing` §2 fixes, read off
    the resolved folder's own name. **Never test the folder's asserted `kind:`** — `/brd-split`
    writes `kind: brd` into the `brd-link.md` it places inside the `PRD-` slice folder it carves
    (`commands/brd-split.md` Phase 3), so a slice **asserts** `brd` while being exactly the folder
    this refusal must accept; a gate on the asserted kind would refuse every slice and accept
    nothing.

    **Where the folder resolved through `workflows-core:addressing` §5's legacy unprefixed fallback,
    there is no prefix to test.** Answer the root question by **positive evidence, never by the
    absence of a file** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1, the
    shared authority every consumer of this test in this plugin takes it from, directly or through
    `workflows-core:addressing` §4.1, and not restated here — and the Epic question the same way, as
    §4.1 places a folder with no prefix: a resolved `kind: epic` is an Epic folder, refused below
    exactly as an `EPIC-` folder is.

    **An `EPIC-` folder is refused on the same prefix test, and at the same moment.**
    `resolve-address` searches every level `workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds, the Epic level
    included, so an Epic's key resolves here exactly as a slice's does — and without this refusal an
    `EPIC-` folder, which is neither `BRD-` nor `PRD-`, passed both this step and step 5b and reached
    step 6 on a folder that holds no decision register, coverage ledger or grounding of its own, whose row-F branch then named a remedy for a BRD it
    is not. A prefix is the name beginning `EPIC-<the resolved key>-`, as §4.1 defines one, so a
    legacy folder whose key merely begins `EPIC-` is not refused by its name.

    On a root, look for the root-level artifacts this run would have produced under the retired
    two-level model — any `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/`, `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md` or
    `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` already in the folder — and name whichever exist in the stop, so an
    operator whose BRD was packaged under that model is told the level moved rather than that their
    key is wrong. Never delete them; they record work done, and nothing in this run reads them.

    Stop:
    `BRD_PACKAGE_ROOT_LEVEL: <BRD-KEY> is a root BRD, and packaging happens at the slice. Carve one with '/product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY> "<how to cut it>"', then run '/product-workflows:brd-package <SLICE-KEY>'.<where root-level artifacts exist, append:> This BRD carries root-level package artifacts at <paths> from the earlier two-level model; it is left in place, and this command never reads it.`

    Stop, on an Epic folder:
    `BRD_PACKAGE_EPIC_LEVEL: <KEY> resolves to an Epic folder at <path>, and packaging happens at a slice carved from a customer's BRD — an Epic is refined from the PRD folder above it and holds no decision register, coverage ledger or grounding of its own. No gate was run and nothing was written. <remedy> Re-running this command on this Epic stops here again.`
    `<remedy>` turns on the folder containing this one: where it carries a `brd-link.md` naming a
    `parent:` — a slice — `Run '/product-workflows:brd-package <SLICE-KEY>' against the slice this Epic sits in.`, `<SLICE-KEY>` being that `brd-link.md`'s own `key`, read and
    never parsed out of either folder's name; anywhere else, `The folder above it is not a slice carved from a customer's BRD, so there is no register for this command to package here.` — naming no command, since step 5b refuses an idea-route PRD folder too. It is an argument halt, so `emit-block` does not fire.
5b. **The idea-route refusal — a `PRD-` folder is a slice only where a BRD carved it.** Step 5a's
    prefix test accepts every `PRD-` folder, and an idea-route PRD folder — `/product-workflows:create-prd`'s
    own output, never carved from a BRD — is one. Take this immediately after 5a, before step 6 opens anything: step 6's row-F
    branch would otherwise send this folder to `/product-workflows:brd-interview`, which refuses it.
    Decide it by **positive evidence, exactly as `/product-workflows:prd-ground` Phase 0 step 5a
    sets `route: idea`**, and never by the absence of a ledger or inventory alone:
    - **A `PRD-` directory carrying no `brd-link.md`** — `/brd-split` is the only writer of a
      `brd-link.md` naming a `parent:` inside a `PRD-` folder, so this one was never carved from a
      BRD.
    - **A folder resolved through `workflows-core:addressing` §5's legacy unprefixed fallback,
      carrying no `brd-link.md`, neither `coverage-ledger.md` nor `brd/brd-inventory.md`, and a
      `prd.md` asserting `kind: prd`** — a legacy idea-route PRD folder
      (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1). The same shape without
      such a `prd.md` is not decided here, and step 6 handles it as it always has.

    Stop:
    `BRD_PACKAGE_NOT_A_SLICE: <KEY> resolves to an idea-route PRD folder (<path> carries no brd-link.md), not a slice carved from a customer's BRD — no gate was run and nothing was written. Packaging bundles a BRD slice's decision register for the customer who wrote the BRD, and this folder has no customer BRD, no coverage ledger and no interview behind it, so there is no register to bundle. The idea route goes on from its PRD: run '/product-workflows:create-ard <KEY>' or '/product-workflows:specify <KEY>' (after '/product-workflows:create-prd <KEY>' where the folder holds no prd.md yet). Re-running this command on this folder stops here again.`
5c. **Refuse a folder holding a torn write — before any gate, so no gate's remedy lands one.** Read
    `decisions.md`, `interview/customer-questions.md`, `code-defect-log.md` and every
    `interview/round-<N>.md` from the worktree, each where it is present, and find every **torn
    write** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §8 defines — an item
    stamped with a round whose record does not exist or does not name it, which a `/brd-interview`
    run left when it stopped before writing that record. This step reads the worktree only and gates
    nothing on a ref, so it runs before step 6: a torn record is most often an uncommitted block in
    `decisions.md`, and step 6's remedy for an uncommitted register is to commit it, which would land
    the torn write on the default branch before anything said what it was. No reader counts one, and
    this command cannot simply leave them out: the bundle carries `decisions.md`,
    `interview/customer-questions.md` and `code-defect-log.md` whole
    (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §1.1), so a torn record or entry would
    reach the customer as a decision nobody recorded taking or a question no round recorded asking.
    Removing them is `/brd-interview`'s alone (§8). **A half-applied re-disposition counts with
    them**: a `[CDF#n]` whose latest `re-dispositioned` move — the highest move number `#k` any
    counted round record's `code defects:` line names for it, never the highest round (§8) — the log
    does not yet carry, the log still reading that move's `<old>` — the log would ship a disposition
    the record has already replaced, and `/brd-interview` completes the move at its next run's
    start. Name each in the stops below beside the torn writes. Any → stop, on the first of these
    that holds:
    - **A round record that exists and cannot be read** — it decides nothing about the items that
      claim its round, and no `/brd-interview` run repairs it:
      `BRD_PACKAGE_ROUND_UNREADABLE: <BRD-KEY>'s <path> exists and cannot be read, so whether the items claiming round <N> (<each, by id or heading>) are torn writes cannot be decided. Repair or restore that file from the specs repo's history (git -C "<SPECS_PATH>" log -- <path>), then re-run. Nothing was written.`
    - **A slice every row of whose `coverage-ledger.md` is an orphan row** — one that kept no
      requirement of its own, where `/brd-interview` stops with `BRD_INTERVIEW_ALL_DELEGATED` before
      it removes anything. Its *Resolve inputs* phase does complete a half-applied re-disposition
      first, since that phase runs before the stop, but the run never reaches its handoff, so the
      completed log is left for the operator to land:
      `BRD_PACKAGE_TORN_WRITES: <BRD-KEY> kept no requirement of its own — every coverage-ledger row is an orphan row — so there is nothing to package. <where torn writes were found:> It holds items a /product-workflows:brd-interview run left when it stopped before writing the round record that would name them (<each, by id or heading, with the round it claims>); no reader counts them, and /product-workflows:brd-interview stops on this slice with BRD_INTERVIEW_ALL_DELEGATED without removing them, so delete them by hand if the files should read clean. <where half-applied re-dispositions were found:> Its code-defect-log.md has not yet taken moves a round record already names (<each [CDF#n] #k <old> → <new>>) — the round record was written and the run stopped before the log was; run '/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>', whose first phase applies them before it stops, then commit and merge code-defect-log.md yourself, since that run hands nothing off. Nothing was written.`
    - **Otherwise:**
      `BRD_PACKAGE_TORN_WRITES: <BRD-KEY>'s folder is not in a state a package can ship. <where torn writes were found:> It holds items a /product-workflows:brd-interview run left when it stopped before writing the round record that would name them (<each, by id or heading, with the round it claims>); no reader counts them. <where half-applied re-dispositions were found:> Its code-defect-log.md has not yet taken moves a round record already names (<each [CDF#n] #k <old> → <new>>) — the round record was written and the run stopped before the log was. Run '/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>' and merge its handoff: any run of it that reaches its handoff removes the torn writes, and any run that passes its input gates applies the pending moves in its first phase. Nothing was written.`
6. **Gate the decision register on main.** This command **consumes** a `$SPECS_PATH` deliverable it
   did not write, so per `workflows-core:phase-handoff` §5 rule 2 it executes
   `require-on-main` (§3) here, before any content is read — step 5c's worktree test reads items
   only to find torn writes, and gates nothing. Execute it against the resolved folder's
   `decisions.md`. **Its presence on `origin/<default>` implies nothing about any other file this
   package ships, and each of those is gated in its own right** (step 6b below for the question set
   and the code-defect log, step 7 for the round records): that a single `handoff-to-main` run
   stages its deliverables in one commit (§2.3) is a fact about that run and not about the tree — a
   handoff declined and hand-committed in part, or a later `/brd-interview` run that stages the
   register and not a question set an earlier run left, lands the register alone
   (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.0, never infer an artifact's merged-ness from a sibling's
   gate). This sentence once claimed the question set merged with the register, and before that the
   round records, and each claim was false in the state it did not name. Map the §3.7 return by `stopped` first: any stopping row → stop, naming the
   concrete branch/PR state it reports; `pass` → proceed; `pass_amending` → proceed, printing the
   §3.3 row-B message; `unmanaged` → proceed as before this feature; `absent` (row F — the register
   is on no ref at all) → **split it before stopping**, on a test row F cannot make, exactly as
   `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` splits its own. Row F covers two states, and sending the second
   one back to `/brd-interview` walks the operator into a wall:

   - **No `decisions.md` in the folder at all** — no interview has written one. `/brd-interview`
     writes the register wherever none is on file, on every run that records a round and on its
     no-new-round path alike, its header line alone where no round recorded a decision
     (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §1). So the folder is one of
     four, and the next `/brd-interview` run writes the register in three of them: a BRD never
     interviewed, where it writes it with round 1; one interviewed before that command always wrote
     it, over rounds that recorded no decision, whose round still open is resumed and whose rounds
     all closed take the no-new-round path — both write it. The fourth is a slice every row of which
     is an orphan row, its parent's walk having withdrawn every claim it made: that command stops
     with `BRD_INTERVIEW_ALL_DELEGATED` and writes nothing, because this slice kept no requirement of
     its own and there is nothing to package.
     `BRD_PACKAGE_NEEDS_INTERVIEW: no decision register on file for <BRD-KEY> — run /product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>; it writes the register, with nothing in it where its rounds recorded no decision, and hands it off. Where it stops with BRD_INTERVIEW_ALL_DELEGATED instead, <BRD-KEY> kept no requirement of its own and has nothing to package.`
   - **A register is in the folder, and on no ref** — the run that wrote it had its handoff
     declined: the interview, ordinarily, or `/product-workflows:create-prd` or
     `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` where either created the register
     (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §1). **Do not send the
     operator back to `/brd-interview`**: whether it opens a new round is
     its *Resolve the round* phase's own test of what changed after the last round was generated — that
     phase's to state, and cited, never restated here — and where the test finds nothing it takes
     the no-new-round path, reaches its handoff phase with nothing staged, reports `nothing to
     commit` and opens no pull request, while where it finds something the round it opens is handed
     off with its own record and not the earlier ones. Either way `handoff-to-main` stages only the
     paths *that* run declared (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §2.3), and the round records already
     on disk are not among them. What is needed is the register already written, landed:
     `BRD_PACKAGE_REGISTER_NOT_HANDED_OFF: <BRD-KEY>'s decision register is written at <path> but is on no branch — its handoff was declined. Commit and merge decisions.md and the interview/ round records to the specs repo's default branch, then re-run; do not re-run /product-workflows:brd-interview, whose no-new-round path stages nothing on an unchanged BRD.`
6b. **Gate the question set and the code-defect log on main, each where it is in the folder.**
    Both ship in the bundle whole (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §1.1),
    and neither is implied by step 6's gate. For each of `interview/customer-questions.md` and
    `code-defect-log.md` present in the folder, execute `require-on-main` against it and map the
    §3.7 return by `stopped` first: any stopping row → stop, naming the file and the branch/PR state
    it reports; `pass` / `pass_amending` / `unmanaged` → proceed as step 6 does; `absent` (row F — in
    the folder and on no ref) → collect it, and stop once after both naming every file collected:
    `BRD_PACKAGE_SHIPPED_NOT_HANDED_OFF: <BRD-KEY>'s <files> are written in the folder but on no branch, while its decisions.md is on the default branch — the run that wrote them had its handoff declined, or a later run landed the register without them. This package would ship what no branch holds. Commit and merge <files> to the specs repo's default branch, then re-run; do not re-run /product-workflows:brd-interview for this, which stages only the files it writes itself. Nothing was written.`
    **A file absent from the folder is not gated**: a slice whose rounds held no `[C]` has no
    question set and one whose decisions turned on no code defect has no log, and neither absence
    is a decline.
7. **Gate on the interview's rounds — and read the precondition the only way that is not a
   deadlock.** Read every `interview/round-<N>.md`.

   **First, derive which rounds must exist, then gate each one.** The set is not "whatever is on
   disk" — that is the thing being checked. `decisions.md` is already on main (step 6), and **every
   record in it that was recorded in a round carries that round** — `[VD#n]`, `[AS#n]` and `[CD#n]`
   alike (`product-workflows:decision-register-format` §1 and §7) — **and so does every entry in
   `interview/customer-questions.md`**, which `/brd-interview` writes with the question's round and
   position. So the rounds this BRD *has* are the distinct `round` values across every record kind
   in the register that carries the field, **together with the round of every held `[C]` entry** —
   none of them a torn write, which step 5c has already refused, and none of which counts
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §8) —
   read off that entry's own heading, `## Round <N>, question <position>`, which
   `/product-workflows:brd-interview` pins as the entry's boundary and spelling for exactly this
   reader (*Hold every `[C]`*): a
   round that held only `[C]` questions puts no record in the register at all, and a set taken from
   the register alone would never gate its record. **A record carrying no
   `round` contributes nothing to the set, and that is correct rather than a hole**: an `[AS#n]`
   written by `/product-workflows:create-prd` for a customer-authority gap came from PRD authoring
   and from no round (`product-workflows:decision-register-format` §7), so there is no
   `interview/round-<N>.md` it could ever name. Requiring one would demand a file no command writes
   and make every slice holding such a record permanently unpackageable. **Two record shapes legitimately omit the
   field and no others**: that `[AS#n]`, and a `[CD#n]` answering it, which `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`
   writes with no round for the same reason (`product-workflows:decision-register-format` §1). A
   `[VD#n]` without one is still a malformed record, and so is any record from a round that omits
   it. Deriving from `[VD#n]` alone leaves the hole open rather than closing it: a round that
   produced only assumptions and `[C]` questions names no `[VD#n]`, and deriving from the register
   alone leaves the same hole one source further out — a round of held `[C]` questions names no
   record at all, so its derived set is empty and the gate passes without checking a thing. The `[C]`
   entries close it. For each of them, execute `require-on-main`
   (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff require-on-main")`, §3) against
   `interview/round-<N>.md`. Map the §3.7 return by `stopped` first: any stopping row → stop, naming
   that round and the branch/PR state; `pass` / `pass_amending` / `unmanaged` → proceed to read it;
   `absent` (row F) → collect it, and stop **once** at the end of the loop naming **every** round
   that came back absent. **Split the collected rounds on a worktree test row F cannot make**:
   whether `interview/round-<N>.md` exists in the folder at all.
   - **Present in the worktree, on no ref** — the record was written and its handoff declined, or
     the run stopped after writing it; landing it is the fix:
     `BRD_PACKAGE_ROUNDS_NOT_ON_MAIN: <BRD-KEY>'s decisions.md and held [C] questions name rounds <list>, but <these> have no interview/round-<N>.md on any ref — the records those decisions and questions came from never merged. Land them on the specs repo's default branch and re-run; do not re-run /product-workflows:brd-interview, whose no-new-round path stages nothing on an unchanged BRD.`
   - **Absent from the worktree too** — after step 5c, the one state that reaches here is a
     re-decision a `/brd-interview` run left standing at a round whose record it never wrote: a
     record carrying a `Reopened` paragraph, which
     `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §8 never counts a torn write.
     There is nothing to land, and `/brd-interview` is the command that writes that round's record
     (its *A later round is generated from what changed*):
     `BRD_PACKAGE_ROUND_NOT_RECORDED: <BRD-KEY>'s decisions.md names rounds <list> through <records>, each a re-decision an interrupted /product-workflows:brd-interview run left standing, and no interview/round-<N>.md for <these> exists anywhere. Run '/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>' and merge its handoff: the round it opens records each such re-decision, and then re-run this command.`
   Where both kinds are collected, print both stops, the second first.

   **A round that only re-decided is in the set, and the round it re-decided out of may not be.** A
   re-decision writes no new record: it writes the existing record's fields under §4's per-field
   rules and moves its `round` to the round that took the position now standing
   (`product-workflows:decision-register-format` §4), so a round whose whole output was
   re-decisions is named by those records and its `interview/round-<N>.md` is required like any
   other — where a round that held only `[C]` questions is named by their entries instead, as above.
   The earlier round the field moved off is named here only where another of its records still
   carries it, or where it held a `[C]`; where neither holds, it drops out of this set, and
   correctly — this gate requires the record the **standing** position came from, which is the
   re-decision's, and no position on file now rests on the earlier one. **Dropping out of this set
   does not make the record unowed, and round 1 is the case that shows why: this gate is not its
   only reader.** `/product-workflows:brd-interview`'s round-1 test reads `interview/round-1.md` on
   every run of that command — its requirement-defect account line is what decides which round an
   open requirement defect belongs in — so a clone that never received round 1's record takes that
   test's *no round record exists* branch and raises every open requirement defect again, in a round
   1 it believes it is generating. `/brd-interview` declares the record in its `deliverable_paths`
   and it is landed there, not here. **Population: narrow** — it needs a declined handoff, every
   record round 1 produced re-decided in a later round, no `[C]` held in round 1, and a second clone
   reading the folder. **Do not repair any of this by enumerating `interview/` instead**: the
   *Deriving the set from the register and the held `[C]` entries* paragraph immediately below gives
   the reason a directory listing cannot see the case this gate was built for.

   **Deriving the set from the register and the held `[C]` entries is what makes the partial case
   visible**, and the partial case is the one this gate exists for: rounds 1 and 2 merged, round 3
   left on a branch. A check that enumerated the directory would find rounds 1 and 2, iterate them
   happily, and never learn that a third was owed — reporting a clean set instead of a missing
   record. Naming every absent round in one message rather than stopping at the first also matters:
   an operator who lands one record and re-runs, only to be told about the next, learns the state
   one round at a time.

   **This gates rather than inheriting step 6's implication**, per `workflows-core:phase-handoff`
   §4.0: never infer an artifact's merged-ness from a sibling's gate. Step 6 gates `decisions.md`
   and the round records rode with it in the run that wrote them, which is a fact about that run and
   not about the tree — a hand-committed set lands partially, which is exactly the case above.

   **Where neither the register's records nor any held `[C]` entry name a round, the set is empty,
   and this gate is silent on it** — there is nothing to require. That state reaches step 8, which
   stops it unless `interview/` holds a round record and an open `[AS#n]` leaves something to
   review. Where it stops it for want of anything to review, its `BRD_PACKAGE_NOTHING_TO_REVIEW`
   reads the rounds as **settled** ("every question its rounds asked was settled from verified
   findings"). That reading is right for a BRD that was interviewed and settled, and wrong for one
   that was never interviewed at all — the two are indistinguishable from the register alone, and
   the difference is whether `interview/` holds anything. Step 8 says which of the two it is by
   testing that directory first, so the message does not congratulate an operator on finishing work
   nobody started.

   Then, over the rounds that exist: stop unless **every question in every round
   carries either a terminal disposition or the holding state *held for the customer*** — the
   vocabulary `/brd-interview`'s *Resolve the round* phase fixes, and the state that phase's
   append-only record **last** records at that question's address, which is what a re-tagged
   question carrying two states at one number turns on. Any question in the *deferred*,
   *needs grounding* or *untagged* holding state → stop, naming each one, its round, its holding
   state and the concrete fix:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_ROUND_UNSETTLED: N questions in <BRD-KEY>'s rounds are still deferred, needs-grounding or untagged — run /product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY> (a needs-grounding question is answered by /product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> first).`

   **Why *held for the customer* is admitted and the other three are not.** The design's
   precondition for this command is that the interview's open rounds are closed, and read literally
   that is a deadlock: a round holding a `[C]` stays open **until the answer comes back through the
   package** (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/interview-tagging.md` §5), and the package is what
   this command builds. So the only reading under which the route can run at all is the one taken
   here — everything the delivery team can settle is settled, and what remains is exactly the set
   this package is being built to carry. The other three holding states are the opposite case: each
   names work that is still ours, and packaging around one asks the customer to approve a position
   the delivery team has not finished taking.

8. **Gate on there being something to review — and report it as a finished state, not a missing
   step.** A package with **no** `[C]` question, **no** open `[AS#n]`, and **no** `[VD#n]` in the
   register has nothing for a customer to confirm, correct or attack. Stop rather than sending it:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_NOTHING_TO_REVIEW: <BRD-KEY> holds no [C] question, no open [AS#n] and no [VD#n] — every question its rounds asked was settled from verified findings, so there is nothing in them for a customer to confirm, correct or attack, and a package built from it would ask for a review of nothing. Whether that leaves this BRD decided is /product-workflows:brd-interview's to say: where it would open a new round, or names the '/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY> --round 1' re-open for open requirement defects no round has asked, that run is the fix, and a bare '/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>' says which, handing off nothing where neither applies. New evidence can make a round askable too: '/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> --rebaseline' re-grounds every claim against current commits. Where none of that applies, this BRD is decided — a finished state, not a missing step, and the delivery team owes the customer no decision here.`
   **Test `interview/` FIRST, and independently of what the register holds.** This was once a branch
   *inside* the stop above — reached only where there was nothing to review — and that placement had a
   hole the moment a second command gained the power to write an `[AS#n]`:
   `/product-workflows:create-prd` writes one for a customer-authority gap and its own gates are
   ledger-based, so a slice **nobody ever interviewed** can hold one open assumption, sail past the
   nothing-to-review test because it has something to review, and ship a package with no `interview/`
   at all — no rounds, no `customer-questions.md` for part 7 to draw on, and a customer prompt built
   from a single assumption. **A BRD with no interview record is not packageable whatever else its
   register holds**, so where `interview/` is absent or holds no round record, stop here before the
   test above runs:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_NOT_INTERVIEWED: <BRD-KEY> has no interview/ round record — this BRD has not been interviewed, so there is nothing yet to put in front of a customer, whatever its register holds. Where it holds an open [AS#n] written by /product-workflows:create-prd, that assumption still needs the interview it never had: a package carries a customer's decisions against a record of what was asked, and there is no such record here. Run '/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>' first.`
   The nothing-to-review stop above then serves only the case it was written for: an `interview/`
   that holds rounds whose every question a verified finding settled.

   **Why the message hands the verdict to `/brd-interview`, and names grounding beside it.** Whether
   a settled BRD still has something to ask is decided by `/brd-interview`'s *Resolve the round*
   phase — its test of what changed after the last round was generated, which opens a new round, and its
   round-1 test, which names the `--round 1` re-open for requirement defects a slice interviewed
   before that question source existed has never asked. Both are that phase's to state and are
   cited, never restated here: this command cannot evaluate either without a second copy of the
   question sources behind them, and that phase already says why this command tests for its round
   record rather than re-deriving those sources — a second copy is how the two commands drift apart.
   So the message does not call the BRD decided on its own authority, which would tell an operator
   whose slice holds unasked requirement defects that no customer review is owed. It names the one
   run that decides and says what that run does where neither test fires — it hands off nothing — so
   the operator is never sent there expecting work it will not do, the no-op offer
   `workflows-core:next-phase-offer` exists to keep out of this route; and beside it, the grounding
   pass that can make a round askable, and the plain fact that stopping is a legitimate outcome.

   Note what this gate does **not** require: a package with `[VD#n]` decisions and no `[C]` question
   at all is legitimate and is packaged. Positions the delivery team took and argued are exactly the
   thing a customer review is for (`interview-tagging.md` §1 — a `[V]` may be *shown* as a position,
   it is merely never *handed over* as a question), and a review that only confirms scope,
   traceability and grounding is a review worth having.
9. **Do not re-gate allocation.** Read `coverage-ledger.md` for the review-scope part of the prompt
   and for the final report's ledger line, but do not gate on it: `/brd-interview` already refused to
   run against an unallocated ledger, and `decisions.md` cannot exist on main without that gate
   having passed. Re-gating here would add a second, differently-worded copy of a rule
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §6.1 already owns, and the two would
   eventually disagree. Where the ledger is read at all, the **dispositions in the file** are read
   and never the ledger line, for the reason that section gives.
10. **Read the inputs the rest of the run works from**, all from the gated folder:
    `decisions.md` (every `[VD#n]` and `[AS#n]` with its `status`, `evidence`, `argumentation`,
    `conditional_on`, `altitude` and `round` **where it carries one**); every verified
    `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` with its `verdict`, `evidence`, `control` where it carries one, `horizon` and
    verifier `outcome`; `grounding/baselines.md`; `brd/brd-inventory.md`'s
    `[BR#n]` rows; `coverage-ledger.md`; every `[CDF#n]` in `code-defect-log.md` with its
    `disposition`, `statement`, `intent` and `blocked_on`, **read where the file is present** — it
    is absent on a package whose decisions turn on no code defect, and its absence is never a gate;
    `brd-link.md`; `interview/customer-questions.md`; every `interview/round-<N>.md`; and, when this
    is a re-package, every earlier `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md`. A previous package's artifacts are
    inputs, never scratch: nothing below deletes, renames or rewrites a dated artifact another run
    wrote.

    **Resolve `brd/source/<basename>`, `brd/brd-defect-log.md` and — where it exists —
    `brd/brd-figures.md` here too**, even though no phase before *Assemble the bundle* reads their
    *content*: all three go into the bundle (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md`
    §1.1) — where that phase reads the figures file's sections to choose which images ship, and runs
    its scans over every copy (rules 7–8) — and on a **slice** none is in this folder at all — each
    resolves one hop up, through the `parent:` this step just read
    (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2.1, §4). Resolving them now rather than at
    assembly is what lets an absent one be reported before the run has built a prompt: a bundle
    missing the customer's own document cannot answer the review's requirement-traceability section,
    and finding that out at the copy step is finding it out too late to say so cheaply. An absent
    figures file is never a gate, any more than an absent `code-defect-log.md` is: an intake that
    copied no image writes none (`commands/brd-intake.md` Phase 2.5), and a BRD intaken before the
    figures file existed holds none, however many images it links.

    **`<basename>` is read off the inventory's `document:`, one hop up on a slice as the three above
    are** — it names which file under `brd/source/` is the customer's document, the one the rows
    were last reconciled against, since that directory also holds the files the document links.
    Never off `brd/brd-link-log.md`'s opening line where the inventory carries `document:`: a rename
    run that stopped before its Phase 3 leaves that line naming a document no row was read from. On
    an inventory carrying none — one written before 3.7.0 that no 3.7.0 intake has run over, whose
    Phase 2 writes one — the log's opening line is read; a BRD intaken before the log existed holds
    exactly one file there, and that file is it; and a log written before its layout was fixed is
    read by the rule that section gives for one (`brd-format.md` §1.1). The log is not a bundle
    document. The *Assemble the bundle* phase reads it: its *Captured links that do not resolve as
    written* table is how an image a captured file reaches through a `[[wikilink]]` or from outside
    the document's own directory is found (`bundle-packaging.md` §2.1), and where the manifest finds
    the target as written it names beside a captured file, markdown or image (rule 6). Only a link
    that does not resolve as written has a row there; one that does reaches its copy by its own
    path, which the manifest's map already carries, so no target as written is named for it.
11. **Fix the run's date.** One `<YYYYMMDD>` stamp, taken once, used for every artifact this run
    writes. If `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/` already exists in the BRD folder, stop:
    `BRD_PACKAGE_BUNDLE_EXISTS: <BRD-dir>/bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/ already exists — a dated bundle is never rewritten. Move or rename the existing directory if it was never sent, or package on the next date.`
    **A dated bundle is never rewritten** (`bundle-packaging.md` §5): rewriting it destroys the only
    evidence of what the reviewer of that date was looking at, and every claim in their returned
    review then silently re-points at a document they never saw. This command cannot tell whether
    the existing directory was already sent, and the party who can is the operator, so it stops and
    says so rather than guessing either way.

---

## Phase 1 — Classify + model routing

Invoke the `model-routing` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "workflows-core:model-routing"`), then record:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: SIGNIFICANT     # floors here — the self-review is adversarial and its output
                                  # gates the run, and the rendered prompt leaves the organisation
  reason: <one-line>
  current_model: <the model this orchestrator is running under>
  detection_model: <§2.1 Sonnet chain: claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6/4-5>   # impl-maintenance only
  review_model:    <§2 Opus chain>     # brd-package-reviewer (frontmatter-pinned; recorded, no override)
  opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
  notes: <any §2/§2.1 fallback or degradation>
```

`brd-package-reviewer` keeps its frontmatter Opus pin regardless of classification, the same way
`grounding-verifier` does in `/prd-ground` — `review_model` is recorded, never used to override the
pin. **The classification floors at `SIGNIFICANT`** because of what this run produces rather than how
much of it there is: a self-review that finds nothing is a rubber stamp, and a rendered prompt is
the one artifact in this plugin that an outside party pastes into an agent and runs, with nobody
from the delivery team present to correct it — a proposal is read outside the organisation too, but
it is read, not run. If no Opus resolves, degrade to best-available, record it in `notes`, in the
self-review's own header and in the final report — a package whose adversarial pass ran on a weaker
model is still a package, and the customer's own reviewer is the second pass, but the operator must
know which they got. Never hard-block.

---

## Phase 2 — Resolve prerequisites and their packages

Persist every `--depends-on` key the *Resolve inputs and gate the decided BRD* phase accepted into
`<BRD-dir>/brd-link.md` under a `depends-on:` list —
**additive only**: merge into whatever the file already carries (including a `parent:` or `claims:`
field another command wrote), never drop an existing prerequisite, and never touch any field but
`depends-on:`. This is the same additive merge `/prd-ground` Phase 4 performs on the same field, and
it is additive for the same reason: the file is also edited by hand between runs, and a run that
replaced the list would silently drop a prerequisite nobody re-declared.

For every declared prerequisite (this run's plus any already on file):

1. `resolve-address <PREREQ-KEY>`. Absent → record `<PREREQ-KEY> — BRD not found`, carry it into *what
   could still move* as a prerequisite whose state is unknown, and do not stop: a prerequisite the
   delivery team cannot resolve is exactly the kind of thing the customer should be told about.
2. Found → determine **whether its decisions have been customer-reviewed**. They have been if and
   only if that folder's `decisions.md` holds at least one `[CD#n]` — a customer decision enters the
   register only once the customer answered and an operator confirmed it (D14,
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §1), so a `[CD#n]` on file is the
   only evidence a review actually came back. Anything less — an open round, a package that was sent
   and not answered, a folder with `[VD#n]` records only — is **not** customer-reviewed.
3. Found → look for its own most recent `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/`. Present → it is copied into this
   bundle by the *Assemble the bundle* phase and marked **not for re-review**. Absent → record
   `<PREREQ-KEY> — no package on file; nothing to copy in`, and say so in the prompt's part naming
   what each package in the bundle is for, rather than referring the customer to a package they were
   not given.

**Step 2's test is written against the register, never against a run's history.** `/brd-reconcile`
is the one command that writes a `[CD#n]`, and it writes one only once an operator has confirmed a
returned answer (D14, `decision-register-format.md` §1) — so a `[CD#n]` on file is evidence that a
review actually came back *and* was confirmed, which is exactly the question step 2 asks. A
prerequisite that was packaged and sent, or whose review is sitting unreconciled in somebody's
inbox, reads *not customer-reviewed* here, correctly: nothing about it is frozen yet, and every
position resting on it can still move.

Carry, for each prerequisite: its key, whether it resolved, whether its decisions are
customer-reviewed, whether a package of its own was found, and **every decision in this BRD's
register carrying `conditional_on: <PREREQ-KEY>/<decision-id>`** (`decision-register-format.md` §5).
Those are the positions D20 obliges the prompt and the delivery note to name, and they are found
mechanically by the field rather than by reading — which is the whole point of the field existing.

---

## Phase 3 — The adversarial self-review

Dispatch `brd-package-reviewer` once, over the whole package, pinned to the Opus chain
(`review_model`, frontmatter-pinned, no override):

→ Agent (subagent_type: "product-workflows:brd-package-reviewer", model: `<review_model>`):
  > "brd_key:    [the BRD key]
  > brd_dir:    [absolute path to the resolved BRD folder]
  > package:
  >   decisions:      [path to decisions.md]
  >   grounding:      [paths to grounding/code-grounding.md and grounding/design-grounding.md]
  >   seeds:          [paths to prd-seed.md / ard-seed.md / spec-seed.md, as they exist]
  >   ledger:         [path to coverage-ledger.md]
  >   defects:        [path to code-defect-log.md, or omit when the folder holds none]
  >   questions:      [path to interview/customer-questions.md]
  >   prior_reviews:  [paths to every earlier self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md, or omit when none]"

Supply the package **exactly as the agent's own Inputs contract declares it**, and supply all of it:
that agent refuses to run without `brd_dir`, `package.decisions` and `package.grounding`, returning
`status: INPUT_MISSING`. Map that return to a stop naming the field it named — it is a defect in
this dispatch, not in the package, and proceeding past it would build a bundle on a review of
nothing.

**One dispatch, not one per document.** The six classes that agent works are cross-document by
construction — a decision read against the finding it cites, a `[C]` question read against the test
that says who may answer it — and an agent handed one document at a time can only find things about
sentences.

**This command does not dispose of anything here, and it does not read a verdict.** The agent
returns `status`, a `findings` list of `[SR#n]` records each carrying `disposition: undisposed`, a
per-class `passes` account, and optional `notes` — **which are recorded in the self-review file alongside the findings**, never dropped: they name a document that could not be read or a pass whose coverage was partial, and a partial pass written into a customer package as though it were complete is the one failure this review exists to prevent. **There is no PASS/BLOCK verdict, deliberately**,
and nothing below waits for one: the gate is the next phase, and a run that looked for a verdict
would sit forever on an agent designed never to emit one.

**An empty findings list is accepted only with its account.** The agent owes a per-pass statement of
what each of the six passes examined; an empty list arriving without it is the same output an agent
produces when it read nothing. Missing account → re-dispatch once, naming the omission; still
missing → stop rather than package against a review that may not have happened:
`BRD_PACKAGE_REVIEW_UNACCOUNTED: brd-package-reviewer returned no findings and no per-pass account — the review cannot be distinguished from a run that read nothing.`

Write `<BRD-dir>/self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` now, before any disposition is taken, holding the
agent's findings verbatim with their classes, targets, attacks, `rests_on` lists and
`what_would_settle_it` statements, plus the per-pass account, the model the pass actually ran on,
and — when this is a re-package — which prior `[SR#n]` each finding restates.

**The dated review owns the numbering, not the dispatch.** `[SR#n]` is scoped to one BRD *per dated
review* (D21's namespace table), and the agent numbers from `SR#1` in **every** dispatch, so the id
this command writes into the review is assigned as the finding is recorded, continuing from the
highest already in that file, with the agent's own pass-local number kept beside it so the mapping
is visible. An id once written into a dated review is never renumbered and never reused; a
re-package is a *new* dated review and starts from `[SR#1]` again, naming the prior review's id
inside each record rather than continuing a sequence across dates.

---

## Phase 4 — The disposition gate

**No bundle is built while any `[SR#n]` is undisposed.** Present each finding to the operator, one
at a time, never batched, with its class, its target, its attack and its `what_would_settle_it`
statement, and take exactly one disposition:

```
choices: ["Fixed — the package has been corrected; say what changed", "Accepted risk — ship it, and show this finding to the customer", "Escalated to the customer — turn it into something the package asks them", "Rejected with reason — the attack does not hold; say why"]
```

**This is not an escalation choice list**, and it is not one of the arrays
`workflows-core:escalation-rules` owns: its four options are the four
disposition values `agents/brd-package-reviewer.md` fixes, drawn from that agent's own contract the
same way `/brd-interview`'s will-change picker draws its three resolutions from
`decision-register-format.md` §6. Its vocabulary is closed, and holding it closed is
required rather than merely permitted: the disposition vocabulary is exactly four values, and a
fifth would be a disposition nothing downstream can read — which is why `workflows-core:escalation-rules` names
this picker in its *Closed-vocabulary pickers must normalise the free-text answer* section, so a
free-text answer that lands on none of the four re-asks rather than becoming a value no consumer
handles. The array is those four values
and nothing else: **there is no listed `Cancel`**, because the harness always supplies a free-text
option and an abort is reachable through it without spending one of the four slots
(`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0). Aborting the walk stops the run with
every disposition already taken still written, so nobody is trapped and nothing is lost — say that
where the walk is introduced, not in an option nobody can be shown.

Each disposition carries a recorded reason, and each has a consequence the later phases execute:

| Disposition | What it obliges |
|---|---|
| `fixed` | **Admissible only where the named artifact is one this command may change** — the prompt, the delivery note, the self-review, the bundle's own rendered copies, and a `[SR#n]`'s own record. **That list is closed and its complement is not enumerated**: `fixed` is unavailable against every other artifact a finding can name, and the test is membership of the five, never absence from a list of exclusions. Four are worth the reason: a ledger disposition, an `interview/customer-questions.md` entry, a register record and a verified `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` — this command mints no `[C]`, writes nothing into the question set (*Render the customer prompt*), changes no ledger disposition (the Final report), and a verified finding is `/prd-ground`'s. A `brd/brd-defect-log.md` entry and `brd/brd-inventory.md`'s `accounts:` record are outside it on the same rule and are named because a live run met both, not because naming them completes anything. Where the artifact is not one of the five, `fixed` is unavailable and the finding takes the agreed-not-actionable route below. **Two of the five admissible artifacts exist when this gate runs and three do not**, so *corrected* means something different for each half and the row says which: the self-review and an `[SR#n]`'s own record are corrected here, before this phase ends; the prompt, the delivery note and the bundle's own rendered copies are written by *Render the customer prompt*, *Render the delivery note* and *Assemble the bundle*, so the correction is recorded against the finding now, in the words the render must carry, and the phase that writes that artifact carries it out — which is the only point at which it can be, and is why no correction here is ever a write into a package document. A `fixed` disposition whose artifact is unchanged — or whose recorded correction the phase that writes that artifact did not carry out — is not `fixed` |
| `accepted-risk` | The finding is listed to the customer under *where to attack us hardest*, in the reviewer's own words — which that agent writes for a customer to read, with no plugin token in them (`agents/brd-package-reviewer.md`). There is no drawer this puts it in |
| `escalated-to-customer` | The finding is put to the customer in the prompt's *decisions the customer must make* part, carried by its own `[SR#n]`. Admissible **only** where `interview-tagging.md` §2's test says so — what would settle it is an authority only the customer holds. Where a delivery-side trade-off would settle it, this is the wrong disposition and the finding takes another |
| `rejected-with-reason` | The reason is recorded in the self-review and stays inside the delivery organisation. Nothing rejected reaches the customer |

**A finding the team agrees with and cannot act on here takes `accepted-risk` and carries a
structured marker saying where it is fixed.** The vocabulary is four values and a fifth would be one
nothing downstream reads, so this case shares a value with a genuine acceptance and is told apart by
a field rather than by prose: record **`fixed-by:`** on the finding — the same device as
the `restates:` marker below — naming **the command that writes the named
artifact**, with what a re-run here would then show. **The marker is written on every finding that
takes this route, and its value has exactly two shapes**: a command, where one writes the named
artifact, and the person or role who must write it by hand, where none does (below). There is no
third shape and there is no unmarked case — part 9 renders from the marker's presence, so a finding
that takes this route unmarked reaches the customer as a risk the team weighed and chose to take,
which is the one swap this route exists to prevent. **The list below is worked
examples of that rule and never the rule itself**, for the reason the row above
gives: the artifacts `fixed` excludes are open-ended, so a marker keyed on an
enumeration leaves whichever artifact the enumeration missed with no route at all.
`/product-workflows:brd-interview` for a question set, a register record or a `[CDF#n]` in
`code-defect-log.md`; `/product-workflows:brd-split` for a ledger disposition;
`/product-workflows:prd-ground` for a finding; `/product-workflows:brd-intake` for
`brd/brd-inventory.md`, its `accounts:` record included, or `brd/brd-defect-log.md`'s own entries;
`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` for a defect resolution a customer's answer settles. **Where the
named artifact has no command writer at all** — a `brd/brd-defect-log.md` entry a grounding finding
would settle is the case on the tree (`references/brd-format.md` §4, and
`/product-workflows:brd-interview`'s *Round 1 is generated from the grounding*) — **the marker is
still written, and it takes the person or role who must write that artifact by hand as its value**:
`fixed-by: <person or role>`, with the recorded reason saying in as many words that no command
writes it. A marker naming a command that does not write that artifact is worse than none: it reads
as routed and nothing is — **which rules on the marker's value and never licenses omitting the
marker**. Omitting it is the worse of the two errors and is the one a live run made: this paragraph
was read as *name a person instead of writing a marker*, and two findings the team had agreed with
went to the customer with no sentence beside them, indistinguishable on the page from the eight
risks that run had genuinely weighed and accepted.

**The marker stays inside the delivery organisation and the customer reads a rendered sentence
instead.** `fixed-by:` travels in the disposition's recorded reason, in
`self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` and in the Final report's grouped listing, and **it is never rendered
into the prompt**: part 9 puts an accepted-risk finding to the customer in the reviewer's own words,
those words may name no command or agent, and the plugin-free scan runs over the *finished* prompt
and hard-stops on a leading-slash command name (`BRD_PACKAGE_PROMPT_LEAK`) rather than sanitising
it. A clause carrying the command name into part 9 would therefore stop the package on the common
path — the P3 run had eleven of seventeen findings in this state — and the only way past the stop
would be to strip the clause, which is this rule reverting itself. **A person-valued marker is
withheld for a reason of its own rather than for that one**: neither the plugin-free scan nor the
citation check stops a person's name, so nothing downstream would catch it, and an individual
inside the delivery organisation is not the customer's to be handed. **So part 9 renders a
generated, plugin-free sentence from the marker's presence**, to the effect of *"we agree with
this; it is recorded for repair outside this package rather than accepted as it stands"* — **one
sentence for both value shapes**, saying only what holds of a command that will write the artifact
and of a person who must write it by hand alike — beside the finding's own
words. The customer then reads *we agree, and this is ours to repair* rather than *we weighed this
and accepted it*, which is the whole point of the distinction, and the renderer reads a field rather
than trusting that someone wrote a clause. Without the marker the two cases are indistinguishable on
the page, and a run that met a wall of agreed-but-unactionable attacks would ship every one of them
as a risk the team had chosen to take.

**A second-pass finding that restates one this run already disposed is not disposed twice.** Present
it with the earlier finding and that finding's standing disposition beside it; where the operator
disposes it the same way, record `restates: [SR#k]` on it and **every part that renders findings to
the customer prints the pair once**, under the earlier id and **in whichever of the two sets of
words says more** — the second pass restates a finding in order to sharpen it as often as to repeat
it, and printing the earlier wording by default silently drops whatever the restatement added, which
is the half the operator disposed it on. Neither is re-written to merge them: one is chosen whole,
and the reason is recorded beside the `restates:` marker. Six attacks the customer reads twice is
a package arguing with itself in front of the person it is trying to convince. Where the operator
disposes it differently it is not a restatement: both stand, and each governs its own finding.

**A finding escalated to the customer again carries a `- **Re-escalates:**` line, and the line is
written from a structured match or not at all.** Every package numbers its findings from `[SR#1]`
again (above), so without it nothing ties a finding a later package escalates to the answer the
customer already gave it under another id, and `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` freezes the new
answer beside the old. On a re-package, once a finding takes `escalated-to-customer`, look for it in
a known set: every finding disposed `escalated-to-customer` in every earlier
`self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` the *Resolve inputs and gate the decided BRD* phase read. It matches one
of them only on structured fields, compared as whole values and never parsed out of prose: the same
`class`, and a `target` whose whole value is the same single bracketed id — a `[VD#n]`, an `[AS#n]`
or another record of this BRD, the form `agents/brd-package-reviewer.md` writes a target in where
the position attacked is one record. Take the most recent earlier self-review holding a match; where
it holds exactly one, write on the new finding's entry in this run's self-review, beneath its
disposition:

```
- **Re-escalates:** self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md [SR#k]
```

naming that file and that finding's id as it stands there. The line names one step: the earlier
finding carries its own line where it re-escalated one before it, and
`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` follows each in turn (its *Confirm every candidate* phase). **No
line is written where nothing structured matches** — a `target` naming a passage of a document or
more than one id, a different `class`, or two matches in one file: the finding goes to the customer
as a new one and its answer is frozen fresh, which is the safe direction, since a wrong line would
judge the answer to one finding against the answer to another. That is also what a self-review
written before this line existed reads as. The Final report names every line written.

**The gate is keyed on every finding carrying a non-`undisposed` value, and on nothing else.** Not
on a count, not on a severity, not on a verdict — the agent emits no severity and no verdict by
design, and `[SR#n]` disposition is the only gate there is. Any finding still `undisposed` when this
phase would end → stop:
`BRD_PACKAGE_UNDISPOSED: N [SR#n] findings are still undisposed — every finding takes one of fixed | accepted-risk | escalated-to-customer | rejected-with-reason before a bundle is built.`

**A `fixed` disposition re-opens the self-review, exactly once, and the trigger is any `fixed`
whatever its named artifact.** A correction changes what the customer will be shown — the five
artifacts the row above admits are the ones this command renders for them — and a correction made
under one finding can break a position another finding left standing. So once every `fixed`
correction has been made or, for an artifact a later phase writes, recorded against its finding,
re-dispatch `brd-package-reviewer` once, with this run's `self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md` — its findings,
their dispositions and each recorded correction — in `prior_reviews`; that agent reads
`prior_reviews` last, after its own passes are complete, which is exactly the ordering wanted here.
**The corrections reach that pass through the review file, not through `package:`**, whose documents
a `fixed` may not change — the review file being the one of them it may. Findings from that second
pass are appended to the same dated review under ids continuing from the highest already in it, and
take dispositions through this same phase. **Once, not until clean**: an unbounded loop trades the customer's review for the delivery
team's, and the second pass exists to catch what a correction broke, not to reach an empty list. A
finding from the second pass may itself be disposed `accepted-risk`, and it then travels to the
customer like any other. **A second-pass finding disposed `fixed` is corrected like any other and
triggers no third dispatch**, which is where the two halves of this rule would otherwise pull apart:
*the trigger is any `fixed`* fixes **which** dispositions open a review, and *exactly once* fixes
**how many times** one is opened in a run — the trigger is spent on the first, whatever disposes the
findings that come back. Its correction is recorded against its finding and carried out by the phase
that writes the artifact, exactly as a first-pass one is, and is read by nothing further here.

`rejected-with-reason` is a real option and is meant to be used. The agent is told to state what
would have to be true for the target to stand precisely so that a rejection has something to argue
against, and a package that disposes every finding `fixed` has either been extraordinarily lucky or
has stopped reading the attacks.

## Phase 5 — Assign the degradation tier

The tier records **what the reviewer was actually able to be given**, it is a fact about the bundle
established here, and it is written into the prompt along with the sentence the reviewer's own
evidence-limitations section must then carry (`bundle-packaging.md` §3).

Read `grounding/baselines.md` for the repositories this package cites and the commit each is pinned
to. Then:

- **No repository in `baselines.md` at all** → the tier is **Documents only**, and the answer is
  determined, so no list is presented. Use the inline-confirmation form the
  `When a choice list fires` rule in `workflows-core:escalation-rules` defines,
  and proceed: `Shipping at the documents-only tier — this package cites no repository, so there is nothing to pin. Say so if the customer can in fact be given one.`
- **Otherwise** → ask, once, for the whole bundle:

  ```
  choices: ["Full — the customer gets the repositories pinned to the commits this package cites", "Partial — the customer gets the repositories, but not pinned (an archive of a moving branch)", "Documents only — the customer gets no repositories", "Cancel"]
  ```

  **Not an escalation array either**: the three options are the three rows of `bundle-packaging.md`
  §3's own table, in that table's order, and a fourth would be a tier nothing downstream can read —
  neither the prompt, which must state the tier and the evidence sentence §3's table pairs with it,
  nor a returned review's own section 1, which is written against that sentence. Its vocabulary is closed, and holding it
  closed is **required rather than merely permitted**, which is why
  `workflows-core:escalation-rules` names this picker among the arrays whose
  free-text answer is normalised into their own vocabulary rather than written through. Nobody is
  trapped: that free-text option is always present, and an answer that lands on none of the listed
  values re-asks rather than inventing a value no consumer handles. No `(Recommended)` marker, and the reason is stated beside
  the list per the `When no option is safe to recommend` guidance in `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "escalation-rules")`: which
  tier is right is not a judgement at all, it is a fact about what this customer can be given, and a
  marker would invite the run to ship at Full because Full is better.

**The tier is never promoted, and this command never assumes one.** A bundle is not quietly shipped
at Full because the repositories were *probably* at the right commit — an unpinned archive is
Partial, and it says so. A reviewer cannot promote themselves to Full by being thorough either, and
the prompt says that too. **A tier is not a quality grade**: a documents-only review that states its
tier is more useful than a full-tier review that does not, because the first can be weighed
correctly and the second cannot be weighed at all.

Carry the tier, and carry the sentence §3's table obliges the reviewer's own section 1 to state. The
prompt renders that sentence verbatim rather than paraphrasing it, so the reviewer is told what to
write rather than left to invent an equivalent.

---

## Phase 6 — Render the customer prompt

Write `<BRD-dir>/customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md`, assembled from the package, **never
hand-written**, in this fixed order. **A `fixed` correction *The disposition gate* recorded against
this artifact is carried out here, in the words that gate recorded**, and is not an exception to
that rule: it is an instruction the assembly follows, taken by an operator against an identified
finding, rather than a part somebody composed freehand. The eleven parts are the design's, and they
are not re-ordered, merged or renumbered for a package that happens to have little to put in one of
them — a part with nothing in it says `none` and says why, for the same reason the review's own
sections do.

| # | Part | Filled from |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Setup | the tier; the fixed capability line, locating instruction and OS note below |
| 2 | What each package in the bundle is for | this BRD, plus each prerequisite package copied in, marked *not for re-review* |
| 3 | Documents to review | the manifest, by its bundled filename, then every other document `bundle-packaging.md` §1.1 admits **except the rendered prompt itself** — §1.1's first row, which is the document the reviewer is reading and not one it sends them to — each by the bundled filename *Assemble the bundle* rule 1 gives it. The manifest still lists the prompt, because it maps what the bundle carries; the two therefore differ by exactly that one entry, by design. **No check reaches that difference** — `bundle-packaging.md` §7's relation 1 is scoped to parts restated from identified records and relation 2 compares the manifest with the bundle, so neither compares this part with the manifest — which is why the rule is written here rather than left for a gate to catch |
| 4 | Code baselines and the verification procedure | `grounding/baselines.md`, with the three commands written out |
| 5 | The single most important claim to verify first | the register, the findings and the held `[C]` entries, by the rule below |
| 6 | Review scope | `coverage-ledger.md` dispositions, `brd/brd-inventory.md`, and every `in-scope` `[CDF#n]` |
| 7 | The decisions the customer must make | `interview/customer-questions.md`, every open `[AS#n]`, and every `escalated-to-customer` `[SR#n]` |
| 8 | What could still move | the prerequisites resolved above, every `conditional_on` position (D20), and every `conditional` `[CDF#n]` |
| 9 | Where to attack us hardest | every open `[AS#n]`, and every `accepted-risk` `[SR#n]` |
| 10 | The required output file, its name, and the inlined schema | the D13 rule, and `render-schema` below |
| 11 | What this session cannot settle | the ledger, the prerequisites, every `out-of-scope` `[CDF#n]`, and the review's own limits |

**No fixed sentence this command renders carries an identifier with a number in it.** Every sentence
this command writes the same way into every package — part 1's capability line, locating instruction
and OS note; the one-line statements parts 6, 8 and 11 carry; part 10's filename instruction; the
delivery note's own wording; the manifest's lines; the note that stands in for the figures file's
frontmatter; and the sentences the de-Obsidianising pass leaves where an image or a link is not
included — writes any example identifier in the placeholder form, `[BR#n]`, never with a number.
The prompt and every bundle document are resolved against this package's own records by *Assemble
the bundle* rule 8, so a numbered example stops the package where that id is absent from the
package's corpus and names an unrelated record where it is present — the rule
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/customer-review-schema.md` §1 gives the schema, for the same
reason. A real record is named only by the id its source artifact carries.

**Part 1 — Setup.** States, in this order: the one-line capability set the prompt assumes — *this
prompt assumes an agent that can read files in a folder and search for a file by name; the pin check
in part 4 additionally needs a terminal, and a reviewer whose tool has none says so in their section
1 and skips it*; what to put on the machine — *the bundle: a folder of markdown files and images.
Point your tool at the folder you were given access to; if it arrived as an archive, extract it to a
real folder first* — and the repositories if the tier gives them any; **the OS note**, written so
each clause names the reader it applies to — *if you extracted an archive: a file browser will show
you the contents of a `.zip` without extracting it and a tool that opens files by name will find
nothing there, and macOS puts the documents one level down inside a folder of the same name. Either
way, filenames contain spaces, so quote them*; what to do if the repositories
cannot be obtained after all — *review the documents and record in your section 1 that no code claim
was independently verified; do not skip the review*; and, once, the rule that governs the whole
session: **read the bundle, write exactly one new file, and modify nothing in the package** (D13).

**Part 6 — Review scope.** State what this BRD is answerable for and what it is not, from
`coverage-ledger.md`'s `disposition` column: the rows reading `covered-here`, `deferred-to`,
`rejected` or `superseded-by` are this package's scope, and a row reading `covered-by: <OTHER-KEY>`
is **out of it**, as is every **orphan row** whatever it reads — a row for a `[BR#n]` this slice's
`claims:` no longer names, which carries the fate its parent's walk settled —
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §3.1, which says why the orphan test
alone reads `claims:`. Name those requirements and the BRD that holds each, in one line apiece, and
say plainly that they are not for review here: a row another slice holds is reviewed in that
slice's own package, and one the parent kept or settled itself is the parent's, with the fate it
gave it. **Cite each such row qualified, as `<PARENT-KEY> [BR#n]`** — the one prose spelling
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.2 gives another BRD's id, `<PARENT-KEY>`
being this slice's `parent:`, whose numbering every `[BR#n]` is — and a `superseded-by` row's
successor the same way wherever this slice does not claim it:
`ACME-90 [BR#12] — held by ACME-90-02`, never `[BR#12] — held by ACME-90-02`. None of these rows is
in this slice's inventory, which holds only what the slice claims
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2.1), so a bare id resolves to nothing there and
the citation-resolution check stops the run on it (*Assemble the bundle* rule 8) — in a part this
run generates, which no operator edit can repair. Which form a row takes is read off that
inventory, as `/product-workflows:brd-interview` reads it (*A row this slice does not claim*): a row
it holds is cited bare.
**Both halves matter to the customer.** Omitting the delegated rows entirely reads as scope the
delivery team dropped, which is the reading a customer is most likely to take and the most expensive
one to correct later; putting them in for review gets the same requirement answered twice, in two
packages, by the same person — the contradiction one `[CD#n]` record cannot hold
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/interview-tagging.md` §5). Naming them as somebody else's is the
only reading that is both complete and true.

**And every `[CDF#n]` disposed `in-scope`**, named by id with its `statement` and its `intent`, under
one line saying plainly that repairing it is inside this package's scope and that the requirements
above depend on it. A defect the delivery team has undertaken to fix is scope, and a scope section
that omits it understates what the customer is agreeing to.

**Part 4 — Code baselines and the verification procedure.** One row per repository: the repository,
the commit it is pinned to, and how that pin was verified. Then the three `baseline-integrity`
commands, **written out with the repository and the commit substituted**, as an instruction to run
rather than a reference to follow — `workflows-core:grounding-format` §4 is the authority for them and is not
citable in the customer's copy, which is exactly why they are inlined:

```
git -C "<repo>" rev-parse HEAD                      # must print <the commit this package cites>
git -C "<repo>" diff --ignore-cr-at-eol --stat      # must be empty
git -C "<repo>" status --porcelain                  # any entry needs a line-count comparison
```

State what each is for and what a mismatch means, and ask for the result in the review's section 1.
At the Partial and Documents-only tiers the block is still printed, marked as unrunnable at this
tier and why — a reviewer who is told the procedure exists and that they cannot run it writes a
better section 1 than one who is told nothing.

**Part 5 — the single most important claim to verify first.** Exactly one, chosen mechanically:
the `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` finding cited in the `evidence` list of the greatest number of `[VD#n]`
records; ties broken in favour of the finding whose falsity would reopen the most `[BR#n]` rows, and
then by lowest id so the choice is reproducible. Where the register cites no finding at all, the
most-depended-on open `[AS#n]` takes the slot, marked as an assumption rather than a finding. Where
it holds no `[VD#n]` citing a finding and no open `[AS#n]` — a register holding only its header
line, whose package carries `[C]` questions alone — the finding named on the greatest number of held
`[C]` entries' `- **Findings:**` lines in `interview/customer-questions.md` takes the slot
(`/product-workflows:brd-interview`, *Hold every `[C]`*, which pins that line so this branch can be
worked mechanically; an entry written before 3.7.0 carries none, and its findings are read from its
prose where they are named there), ties broken as above; where no entry names one, part 5 says
plainly that no position in this package rests on a code or design finding, and names no claim.
**One, because a list of five is not a first**: the purpose of the part is to spend the reviewer's
freshest attention on the claim carrying the most weight, and a list spends it on choosing.

**Part 7's three sources, and why the third is admissible.** The design fixes that every item here is
traceable to a `[C]` question or an open `[AS#n]`. An `escalated-to-customer` `[SR#n]` is traceable in
the same way — to a recorded, identified finding in this run's own self-review, which the customer
can cite back — and part 7 is the only part that asks the customer to decide anything, so a
disposition whose whole meaning is *ask them* has nowhere else to go. **This command mints no `[C]`
identifier and writes nothing into the interview's question set**: tagging a question is
`/brd-interview`'s discipline, and a package that raised `[C]` questions of its own would put a
question to the customer that never went through the tag test — the failure `interview-tagging.md`
§2 exists to prevent, arriving one command later. The escalated finding travels under its `[SR#n]`,
and the answer comes back in the review's section 7 like any other.

**Each held `[C]` entry is rendered with what the customer needs to answer it and to cite it**: the
question as it will be put; its round and position, which the review's section 7 cites it by; the
findings on its `- **Findings:**` line, with their verdicts — an entry written before 3.7.0
carries no such line, and its findings are read from its prose where they are named there, because
a `[C]` rendered with none asks the customer in the abstract, which is what pinning the line
prevents; and, where the entry carries them, the
`[DEF#n]` on its `- **Requirement defect:**` line and the path on its `- **Defect image:**` line
(`/product-workflows:brd-interview`, *Hold every `[C]`*). The image path is how the reviewer finds
the picture a question about an image-drawn requirement is about — the manifest maps it to the
image's bundled filename (*Assemble the bundle* rule 6) — so an entry rendered without it asks about
a picture the reviewer cannot locate.

**Part 7 and part 9 both carry every open `[AS#n]`, and that duplication is deliberate.** They ask
for different things. Part 7 asks the customer to **decide** — an assumption is corrected in one
sentence while it is still an assumption, and that is the cheapest correction in the whole loop.
Part 9 invites them to **attack** it. Removing either copy as redundant loses one of the two, and
the one that gets lost is always the attack. **Every** open `[AS#n]` appears — not the ones that
seem material, not the ones somebody remembered — because the selection step is where this rule
would fail (`decision-register-format.md` §7). Each carries its `statement`, its `evidence` field's
account of why no evidence exists, and its `argumentation`.

**Part 8 — what could still move (D20).** Every declared prerequisite whose decisions are **not yet
customer-reviewed**, named, with what is unsettled about it; and every position in this package
carrying `conditional_on` one of them, named by its `[VD#n]` and its `statement`. A package may ship
while a prerequisite is unreviewed — **loudly**, which is what this part is. Say in one line what
the customer's own review should then do about it: mark the affected approvals in their section 3 as
contingent, and **not** list the prerequisite in their section 10 as a blocker, because it is not
blocking, it is unsettled, and the two get very different treatment on the delivery side. A package
with no prerequisite at all says so explicitly — a reviewer who was told nothing could move writes
no contingent rows, and their absence then means what it says.

**And every `[CDF#n]` disposed `conditional`**, named by id with its `statement` and its `blocked_on`.
An unsettled scope condition on a repair is exactly what this part is for: say what would have to be
settled before the delivery team can say whether the repair is in scope, and — as with an unreviewed
prerequisite — tell the customer's reviewer to mark the affected approvals contingent rather than
listing them as blockers.

**Part 9 — where to attack us hardest.** Every open `[AS#n]`, and every `[SR#n]` this run disposed
`accepted-risk`, each in the reviewer agent's own words rather than re-summarised — that agent
writes its findings knowing they may end up here, and writes their `target`, `attack` and
`what_would_settle_it` for a customer to read, with no `§` of a plugin file, working filename,
command or agent name in them (`agents/brd-package-reviewer.md`), so they pass both checks that read
the finished prompt as quoted: the plugin-free scan stops on a `§`, a command or an agent name, and
the citation-resolution check (Phase 8 rule 8,
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.2 relation 3) on a working filename. A
token that reaches the prompt this way anyway stops whichever of the two catches it, like any other;
the finding's words are still not this command's to change. **Where the finding carries
`fixed-by:`, this part adds one generated sentence beside those words** — plugin-free by
construction, saying the team agrees and that it is recorded for repair outside this package rather
than accepted as it stands (*The disposition gate*). **One sentence serves both shapes the marker's
value takes**: a command that writes the artifact and a person who must write it by hand are both
outside this package, and the sentence says only what holds of both — an earlier wording promising
*a later step of our process* asserted a routing the person-valued half does not have, which is the
same swap in the other direction. It is generated **from the marker's presence and
never from its value**, and that holds for both shapes, each for its own reason: a command name is
exactly what the plugin-free scan stops on, and a person's name is an internal identity neither
that scan nor the citation check would stop and no customer is owed. Nothing disposed `fixed` appears (it is
no longer true of the package), and nothing disposed `rejected-with-reason` appears (the rejection
is ours to own, and shipping an attack the team has already argued against invites the customer to
referee an internal disagreement). **A package that names its own weak points gets a review worth
having; one that does not gets a rubber stamp** — which is the entire reason this part is assembled
rather than written.

**Part 10 — the output file and the inlined schema.** The output filename:
`<BRD-KEY> Customer Review <YYYYMMDD>.md`, with `<BRD-KEY>` substituted and **`<YYYYMMDD>` left as
an instruction rather than a value** — it is the date the *reviewer* finishes, and this run does not
know it. Say so in as many words, and work the example from a review date rather than a packaging
one: a review of `EPIC-008` finished on 22 April 2026 is `EPIC-008 Customer Review 20260422.md`.
**Never substitute this run's own `<YYYYMMDD>` stamp here**, however tempting the symmetry with the
prompt, the note and the bundle: those three are dated by when they were *built*, and a returned
review is dated by when it was *written*. Stamping the package's date onto the filename makes the
customer echo it back, and `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` then derives the review's date from a
filename that records when the delivery team sent the package — which is the one thing that phase
says the date must not be. Ask for the same date in the review's section 1, so the file and its own
first section agree and either can settle it. One line saying it is the only file to send back. The
D13 rule stated **again** here, having already been stated in part 1, because an agent asked to
review documents will otherwise helpfully edit them. Then the schema, inlined by `render-schema`
below.

### Entry point: `render-schema`

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/customer-review-schema.md`.
2. **Confirm the file still declares its own render boundary.** Its preamble states that the
   rendered body is everything from section 2 onward, and that the preamble and section 1 are
   addressed to the delivery team. **Match it wrap-insensitively** — collapse runs of whitespace in
   the file and in the sentence sought before comparing — because that file is hard-wrapped and the
   statement straddles a line break there, so a line-anchored search finds nothing and stops a
   correct package on the next line's stop id. Absent or reworded → stop:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_SCHEMA_BOUNDARY: customer-review-schema.md no longer declares which part of it is rendered — a render that guesses the boundary is exactly the leak D12 exists to prevent.`
   The boundary is read out of the file rather than hard-coded here so that the file and its renderer
   cannot drift apart, which is the same reason the schema is inlined rather than quoted.
3. Take everything from the first `## 2.` heading to the end of the file. **Never the whole file.**
   Everything above that heading is the preamble and section 1, and the preamble is where that file
   deliberately collects its `references/…` citations, its design-spec path and its decision-row
   references — every one of which is unresolvable to a reader with no plugin.
4. **Renumber the body's own headings under the part they are rendered into** — `## 2.` becomes
   `### <part>.1`, and so on through `## 6.` becoming `### <part>.5`, `<part>` being the number of
   the prompt part this body is rendered as. That answers both halves of the problem at once: the
   pasted prompt does not visibly begin at section 2 and invite the reader to hunt for a section 1
   they were never given, **and it does not restart at 1 inside a numbered outline either** — a body
   renumbered `1.`–`5.` inside part 10 of eleven reads as 1–10, then 1–5, then 11, which tells the
   reader they have lost their place rather than that they have reached a sub-section. Demoting the
   level is half of it and the anchored number is the other half: a `###` that still read `1.` would
   collide with part 1. This is safe
   because that file refers to its own sections **by name** and never by number, so nothing inside
   the extracted body cross-references a heading by its pre-render number. Verify it rather than
   trusting it: the extracted body must contain **no `§` character**, which is this plugin's own
   notation for a numbered cross-reference. Any `§` in the body → stop under the scan below rather
   than renumber around it. Every plain "section N" that remains inside the body is a section of the
   **review being written**, numbered 1 to 12, which is the schema's own rule and the reason a bare
   number there is never ambiguous to the reader who matters.

   **Verify, the same way, that the body holds no identifier with a number in it** — no match for
   `\[[A-Z]+#[0-9]+\]`. That file's section 1 writes every example in the placeholder form, `[BR#n]`,
   because the prompt is a bundle document and *Assemble the bundle* rule 8 resolves every numbered
   identifier in it against this package's own records: any example number stops the package where
   that id is absent from the package's corpus, and resolves, silently, to an unrelated record where
   it is present. Which of the two a given number meets is a fact about each package — a code
   finding numbered twelve is absent from every package holding fewer, and a requirement numbered
   four is absent from every slice whose inventory, which holds only the rows the slice claims in
   its parent's numbering, does not claim that row. Any match → stop, before anything is rendered:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_SCHEMA_EXAMPLE_ID: customer-review-schema.md's rendered body carries <id> — an identifier with a number in it, in text rendered into every customer prompt, resolves against the packaged BRD's own records: to a record nobody meant, or to nothing. Write the example in the placeholder form that file's section 1 fixes, [BR#n].`
5. Render the result under a heading of the prompt's own, introduced in one line as the rules the
   returned review must satisfy.

**Part 11 — what this session cannot settle.** Beyond the three sources the parts table already
names for it — the ledger, the prerequisites, and the review's own limits — every `[CDF#n]`
disposed `out-of-scope`, named by id with its `statement`, under one line saying the defect is
recorded and this engagement will not repair it. A known defect the package will not fix is a limit
on what the package can promise, and a customer who meets it here can argue about it while the
scope is still open — which is cheaper for both sides than meeting it after delivery.

### The plugin-free scan

The last thing this phase does, over the **finished** prompt text — not over the templates, and not
over the schema alone. Stop the run on any hit, naming the token, the part it landed in, and the
artifact it was interpolated from:

| Class | Examples |
|---|---|
| A path rooted at the plugin's install directory | the plugin-root variable, in any form |
| A reference-file citation | `references/…`, a bare `workflows-core:<name>` loader argument, the `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", …)` call itself, `docs/superpowers/…` |
| A numbered cross-reference in this plugin's notation | any `§` |
| A slash command | `/brd-…`, `/dev-workflows:…`, `/workflows-core:…`, any leading-slash command name |
| An agent, subagent type or skill name | `subagent_type`, any `<plugin>:<name>` prefix (`dev-workflows:`, `workflows-core:`, and any namespace a later split adds), any agent filename |
| A decision-row reference | `D12`, `D13`, `D18`, `D20`, or any other bare `D<n>` row id |

`BRD_PACKAGE_PROMPT_LEAK: the rendered prompt carries <token> in part <n>, interpolated from <artifact> — the prompt is read by somebody with no plugin, and a token they cannot resolve is not fixed by deleting it. Where <token> is a § quoting the customer's own section number with no captured path, write it as the path and the section, source/<basename> › § <n>, which bundle-packaging.md §6.3 rule 1 exempts.`

**The scan stops; it never sanitises.** A citation that reached the prompt reached it because some
sentence in the package assumed a reader who has this plugin, and stripping the citation leaves that
sentence unfollowable while making it look fine.

**The customer's own words and naming can be neither sanitised nor corrected, and the scan must say
so rather than deadlock.** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.3 defines both
sets of span this covers: **verbatim customer content** — the customer's own files, copied byte for
byte and immutable by rule (§2.1 there, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1), and
the parts of the figures file, the inventory, the coverage ledger and the register that transcribe
or quote their words — and **customer-derived locators**, the customer's names for their own files,
headings and links, in the positions §6.3 recognises them in, this package's own writing included. A
hit inside either is not a leak this package committed. It is the customer having written the token
themselves, in a document, a screenshot, a heading or a folder name — because they were told what
tooling the delivery team uses, or because their own numbering happens to look like ours, a `§ 4.2`
in a specification or a `D3` in a diagram. Report it, grouped as §6.3 fixes, and **put it to the
operator on the one question §6.3's *The operator's ruling* fixes** — ship it as the customer's own,
recommended, or hold the package, which stops with `BRD_PACKAGE_CUSTOMER_CONTENT_HELD` — asked once
per pass and never again for a hit an earlier ruling in this run covered; where §6.3 counts it no
hit at all, there is nothing to report or ask. Stopping outright would make that BRD permanently
unpackageable, since the only repair left would falsify the record — an edit to an immutable file,
an anchor that no longer names where the requirement is stated, a transcription saying something the
image does not, or a quotation saying something the customer did not — and every other span's hit
stays a hard stop exactly as above. **These two sets are the plugin-free scan's only exemptions, and
each covers a class of content rather than one file** — the citation-resolution check (Phase 8 rule
8, `bundle-packaging.md` §6) carries the same two over the same spans, and one of a different shape
for `[SR#n]` (§6.3) — and they exist because the alternatives are a deadlock or a falsified record.

Identifiers are **not** in the scan's classes and are meant to travel: the classes
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.1's table enumerates are how the returned
review cites the package's own claims without minting identifiers of its own, and a prompt that hid
them would get back a review nothing could be matched to. **Cited rather than re-listed, and that is
the fix rather than the style**: this sentence carried its own copy of the list, six classes against
a table that already held eight before this branch added its own ninth, and there is no reason a
second copy would fare better.

---

## Phase 7 — Render the delivery note

**First, settle the delivery route — this is the only phase that may settle it, and it does so from
what the run holds here, never from the *Handoff* phase's outcome.** That phase runs two phases
later, and the note this phase writes is one of the files it commits, so the note cannot wait on its
`Phase handoff:` line. What the repository route depends on is the bundle reaching the specs
repository's default branch, where a customer pulling the repository finds it — which it does when
the handoff's pull request merges — and three facts decide whether this run can start it on its
way, all of them held before anything is committed: the specs repository passes
`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §2.1's gate — `$SPECS_PATH` an existing directory,
`git -C "$SPECS_PATH" rev-parse --git-dir` succeeding there, the resolved `.git` directory
writable, and the run not carrying `specs_git: blocked`; §2.1's push-target probe finds an `origin`
remote to push to; and the operator consents to the handoff. Take all three here:

1. **Take the handoff's consent now.** Invoke
   `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff")`, test §2.1's gate conditions —
   each is a read — and run its push-target probe, printing §4.3's no-remote line above the array
   where the probe set `remote: none`; then present its §4.3 choice array verbatim:

   ```
   choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git (the next phase will stop until this is on main)", "Cancel"]
   ```

   Carry the answer and the probe's `remote` value. The *Handoff* phase executes on the answer,
   hands that `remote` to `handoff-to-main` — which §2.1 and §4.3 expect carried rather than probed
   a second time — and does not ask again, so the operator answers once and the note and the commit
   follow the same answer. **Options 2 and 3 decline the handoff and nothing else** (§4.3, *What
   each option means*): the run continues, the note takes the archive route below, and the
   *Handoff* phase emits the declined outcome line. `Cancel` here is not an abort of the run.
2. **Settle the route from those facts.** Do not ask a question whose answer the run already holds.
   - **The first option taken, every gate condition met, and `remote: origin`** → ask, once:

     ```
     choices: ["They pull the specs repository (Recommended)", "Send them an archive"]
     ```

     The recommendation stands because a bundle whose pull request has merged is where a customer
     with repository access can reach it, and the archive is then a copy of a thing they have.
   - **Any other state — the handoff declined, a gate condition unmet, or `remote: none`** → do
     not ask. Take the archive route and say why in the delivery-route item (*Next steps*): nothing
     this run does will put the bundle where a customer can pull it — a declined handoff and a
     failed gate commit nothing, and with no remote a commit stays on this machine.

**What this phase cannot hold is the handoff's outcome** — the branch it pushes to, which §2.2 may
suffix, and whether that branch's pull request merges — because both come after the note is
written. So the note names no branch: on the repository route it names the repository and the
bundle's path, which is true once the bundle is on the default branch, and the *Handoff* phase then
settles what makes it true on the outcome it got, for the delivery-route item the *Next steps* phase
prints beside the note. The note is not rewritten for any outcome.

Write `<BRD-dir>/customer-delivery-note-<YYYYMMDD>.md` — the covering letter that goes in the email
body. **It is not part of the bundle** (`bundle-packaging.md` §4): it is the email, not a package
document, and a copy of it inside the bundle would be a second, divergent statement of what was
sent. The *Assemble the bundle* phase does not copy it in, and the manifest does not list it.

It states only: which BRD this is; **how the customer gets the bundle**, shaped by the route just settled (`bundle-packaging.md` §4) — on the **repository** route, the repository to pull, the committed `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/` directory by path, and the instruction to open the prompt file there and paste it; on the **archive** route, what is attached. This is the one document that names a delivery route, and the only one that may: it is written to a customer whose situation the operator knows, where the prompt is handed on to a reader the run cannot see (§5); which repositories, at which commits; **which
file is the prompt** — the one file to paste; **which file comes back** — the one file to send,
named exactly; any prerequisite whose decisions are still provisional and that positions resting on
it could move (D20); and anything else that must not sit buried inside a document. The two bolded
items are bolded in the rendered note too, because the single most common failure of this loop is a
reviewer who reads the documents, forms a view, and writes it into an email of their own devising —
having been told, in the first thirty seconds, neither that there was a prompt to paste nor that
there was a named file to return.

**Hard length rule: 200 words. Not a target, a ceiling.** Count the rendered note's words and refuse
to ship one over it — shorten and re-render rather than trimming the two bolded facts, which are the
last things to go. Past roughly that length the note stops being a covering letter and becomes a
document, and a document is precisely what nobody reads before clicking into the attachment, which
puts the two facts that must not be missed back inside the thing they were lifted out of.

**It is not a per-file table.** The manifest inside the bundle covers per-file detail, and
duplicating it here guarantees the two disagree after the first correction.

Run the plugin-free scan over the finished note, exactly as over the prompt, and stop on any hit
save one `bundle-packaging.md` §6.3 covers, which is put to the operator as it is over the prompt —
the note is read by the same reader, on the same footing, before they open anything.

Print the note **in full** at the start of *Next steps*, before that phase's offer, with its
delivery-route item directly after it — so the operator reads what they are being offered before
they answer, and can paste the note into an email without opening a file.

---

## Phase 8 — Assemble the bundle

Write `<BRD-dir>/bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/`. The bundle is a **rendered copy**, produced on the way out;
the working documents keep their wikilinks and are never rewritten in place
(`bundle-packaging.md` §2).

**What goes in is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §1.1's allow-list, applied
verbatim** — the rendered prompt; the customer's own source document, every other markdown file
`/brd-intake` captured under `brd/source/` or `brd/source-external/`, the defect log and, only where
it exists, `brd/brd-figures.md` (**the parent's on a slice**, one hop, since a slice holds none of
them — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1.1, §2.1, §4);
`brd/brd-inventory.md`; `coverage-ledger.md`; `code-defect-log.md`, when the folder holds one;
`grounding/code-grounding.md`, `grounding/design-grounding.md` and `grounding/baselines.md`;
`decisions.md`; `interview/customer-questions.md`; every prerequisite package resolved above, copied
in and marked **not for re-review**; every image those documents reference — including one a
captured file reaches through a `[[wikilink]]` or from outside the document's own directory, found
through the link log (`bundle-packaging.md` §2.1) — and every image the figures file holds a section
for, save one whose section carries the marker `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1.2
fixes and whose *Rows* line yields no row; and a manifest, which maps every captured file the bundle
carries from its path relative to `brd/` to its bundled filename (`bundle-packaging.md` §1.1). Plain
markdown and images, and nothing else.

**What does not go in:** the delivery note; **`self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md`**; every other working
record in this BRD folder (`slices.md`, `brd-link.md`, the seeds, the round records, an earlier
reconciliation or returned review, `dev-workflows/`); and anything a reader outside a vault cannot
see.

**The self-review exclusion is the one that would not survive being left to judgement, so it is
stated here as well as in §1.1.** That file holds every `[SR#n]` this run raised, including the ones
the *disposition gate* disposed `rejected-with-reason` — whose reason "stays inside the delivery
organisation. Nothing rejected reaches the customer." The `[SR#n]` content the customer may see
reaches them **filtered**, through part 9 and part 7 of the prompt; the file carries the unfiltered
set, plus the model the adversarial pass actually ran on. It sits in this same folder under the same
`<BRD-KEY>`-and-date naming as the prompt and the delivery note, so nothing about its filename marks
it as internal — which is exactly why the rule is written down rather than inferred. **The
plugin-free scan below would not catch it**: that scan hunts plugin-internal tokens, and a
self-review is free of them while being the most internal document this command writes.

1. **Name every bundle document distinctively.** Documents are located by **filename search, never
   by path**, because a path is correct exactly once — in the directory layout this machine had —
   and the bundle will be extracted, renamed, re-zipped and mailed on. So each document's bundle
   filename begins `<BRD-KEY>-` and is unique within the bundle, and every reference from one
   bundle document to another, and every instruction in the prompt that sends the reviewer to a
   document, names that filename and tells them to search for it. **Every file the bundle carries
   takes the prefix, images included** — an image copied in is named `<BRD-KEY>-` followed by its
   own basename. **Where two of this package's own images share a basename** — frames in different
   `design/<frame-set>/` folders, or one under `brd/source/` and one under `brd/source-external/` —
   each takes, between the prefix and the basename, the shortest run of its own trailing folder
   names that tells it from every other, joined by `-`: `design/login/01.png` and
   `design/checkout/01.png` become `<BRD-KEY>-login-01.png` and `<BRD-KEY>-checkout-01.png`.
   **Then test the name against every other name the bundle carries** — documents and images alike,
   and not merely against the images that shared a basename, because a disambiguated
   `<BRD-KEY>-login-01.png` collides with the plain name of an image whose own basename is
   `login-01.png`, which no comparison among the sharers ever looks at. Where two names still
   coincide, the one whose path sorts later, byte-wise, takes `-2` before its extension, and the
   test runs again — `-2` can collide in its turn — until every name in the bundle is unique. A
   prerequisite package's filenames are among the names tested and are never renamed (below), so a
   collision with one is resolved on this package's file; one **between two prerequisite packages**,
   which neither may rename, cannot arise. Every bundled name opens with its own package's key, so
   two names from different packages could only collide where one key is the other's prefix **at a
   segment boundary** — `<KEY>` against `<KEY>-1` — and distinct keys alone do not rule that out,
   the key grammar fixing no depth (`workflows-core:addressing` §1). What rules it out is what gets
   copied in: **only a package is, and only a slice has one**, since a bundle is written by this
   command alone and this command refuses a root (*Resolve inputs and gate the decided BRD*, the
   root refusal). One slice's key could be another slice's segment-boundary prefix only if that
   first slice were itself the second's **root**, which no slice is — a slice sits one level under
   its BRD and nothing carves a slice under a slice. So the repetition always has a name it is
   allowed to move. The name is decided by
   the paths, never by the order images were copied in. An
   embedded image in a rendered document points at that name (rule 2), and the manifest maps it
   (rule 6). **The `<BRD-KEY>` is the key of the package the document belongs to, not this run's
   key applied uniformly:** a prerequisite package copied in under rule 5 arrives already named from
   the packaging run that built it, and those keyed filenames are kept on the way in — nothing
   renames them. That is what keeps one bundle's two `[CG#7]`s apart, because it is the same key
   rule 8's check partitions the corpus on
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.1); re-prefixing every document with
   this run's key would collapse the corpus to one partition and let a cross-package citation
   resolve to the wrong finding while the check went green.
2. **De-Obsidianise every copied document — except the customer's own files, the source document and
   every other markdown file `/brd-intake` captured, which are copied byte for byte**
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §2.1). Every `[BR#n]` drawn from their
   text anchors into them, in the forms `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2 fixes,
   so a rendered copy breaks the traceability they are in the bundle to support; they are immutable
   by rule; and they are the customer's own writing going back to them. Anything in them a plain
   reader cannot open is named **in the manifest**, never fixed in the file. For every *other*
   document: rewrite wikilinks to plain filename references — save a `[[…]]` or a link quoted in an
   inventory or ledger `text` cell, in a `[CD#n]`'s quoted `argumentation` or `chosen`, or inside
   an `[SR#n]`'s `target`, `attack` or `what_would_settle_it` as parts 7 and 9 render them, which is
   somebody else's words — the customer's, or the reviewer's, which *Where to attack us hardest*
   says are not this command's to change — and stays exactly as written (`bundle-packaging.md`
   §2.1) — and get the
   three cases `bundle-packaging.md` §2 names right: an **aliased** link keeps the alias as the
   visible text *and* names the file; an **embedded image**
   becomes an ordinary markdown image reference to the image copied in beside it, or — when the
   image is not copied — a plain sentence saying what was there and that it is not included; and a
   link whose **target is not in the bundle** is never rewritten into a bare filename, but becomes a
   plain description of the target and an explicit statement that it is not included. A filename
   that is not in the bundle is the failure the whole pass exists to prevent: it looks resolvable,
   the reviewer searches, finds nothing, and cannot tell whether the file was forgotten, withheld or
   renamed.
3. **Keep callouts.** A callout block degrades to an ordinary blockquote in any reader — the label's
   styling is lost and every word is kept. Nothing that survives untranslated is worth translating.
4. **Remove anything that renders in exactly one tool** — canvas or database-view files, query or
   dataview blocks, plugin-specific embed syntax, frontmatter that means nothing outside the vault —
   converting it to something that renders everywhere, or removing it **with a note saying what
   stood there**. **Frontmatter is a class here and not one file**: every bundled document that
   carries a frontmatter block loses it whole — the inventory's and the ledger's as much as the
   figures file's — because none of it means anything to a reader outside the vault and each names
   plugin-internal fields. The figures file is worked rather than singled out: its frontmatter goes
   whole, `written_by:` and `source:` with the rest, and its note names the customer's document by
   its bundled filename (`bundle-packaging.md` §1.1); every other file's note names what the block
   held in the same way. **The customer's own captured files are outside this rule entirely** —
   they are copied byte for byte (rule 2), frontmatter included, and anything in them a plain reader
   cannot open is named in the manifest rather than fixed in the file. A block that silently
   renders as nothing is the same defect as a dead wikilink: the reviewer cannot see that they are
   missing something.
5. **Copy each prerequisite package in, marked *not for re-review*.** The marking is on the
   documents' own front matter line in the bundle and in the manifest, and the prompt's part 2 says
   what each is for. A prerequisite package is context for the positions this package took on top of
   it — it is not a second package to review, and a reviewer who reviews it anyway spends their
   effort on decisions another review already settled or will settle.
6. **Write the manifest**, listing documents **by filename** — the same reason rule 1 names them
   that way — with one line each saying what the document is and whether it is for review or *not
   for re-review*. **Then map every captured file the bundle carries** — each markdown file and each
   image from `brd/source/` and `brd/source-external/` — from its path relative to `brd/` to its
   bundled filename, naming beside it any target as written that the link log maps to it
   (`bundle-packaging.md` §1.1, §2.1) — **and map every other image whose bundled name took a folder
   or a `-2` under rule 1**, a frame among them, from its path in the BRD folder to that name, since
   its basename alone no longer tells a reviewer which picture it is. **A `-2` earns the map on its
   own**: rule 1's uniqueness test can put one on an image that took no folder at all, and a name
   that is neither the basename nor the basename under a folder is exactly the one a reviewer cannot
   place. A figures section's heading, an
   appendix or image anchor, and an interview question naming an image all give that relative path,
   and none of them is a bundle filename. **Rule 8's relation 3 does not test a quoted target as
   written** (`bundle-packaging.md` §6.2): it sits beside the bundled filename it maps to and quotes
   the customer's own link, so the `notes.md` a `[[notes.md]]` link names is a map entry here, not a
   reference to a bundle document.
   **This is not the whole of what the manifest carries, and the two obligations left over are the
   reference's rather than a fourth and fifth item here**: `bundle-packaging.md` §1.1 puts a file
   `/brd-intake` captured that is neither markdown nor an image — `pricing.pdf` and its kind — in
   the manifest as **captured and not bundled**, beside the captured file it was linked from, that
   being the disposition of a file the allow-list has no row for; and §2.1 puts there what a plain
   reader may not be able to see in a file copied byte for byte — an embedded image, a one-tool
   block — the fix for which is beside the file and never inside it, the manifest being prose this
   package wrote while the customer's files are not. Work rule 6 with those two sections open: what
   is enumerated above is this command's contribution to the manifest, not its contents.
   The manifest is a bundle document; the delivery note is not.
7. **Run the plugin-free scan over every document in the finished bundle**, and stop on any hit
   outside verbatim customer content and customer-derived locators, whose hits are the operator's
   to rule on exactly as `bundle-packaging.md` §6.3 disposes of them (*The plugin-free scan*,
   Phase 6). The scan runs here as well as over the prompt because a leak can arrive through a
   copied document as easily as through a rendered part, and together with rule 8's
   citation-resolution check, this pair is the last point at which anything is still ours.
8. **Run the citation-resolution check over every document in the finished bundle**, per
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6, and stop on any hit. It runs here and
   nowhere earlier because both of its inputs — the identifier corpus and the set of bundle
   filenames — are facts about the *assembled* bundle; the rendered prompt is covered because the
   prompt is itself a bundle document. It is a second pass rather than a widening of rule 7's scan:
   that scan hunts tokens a reader **cannot resolve**, and this one hunts tokens a reader **resolves
   to the wrong thing**, which is the worse failure and needs the bundle's own corpus to detect.

   A reference that resolves to nothing — an unresolved id or filename (§6.2 relations 1 and 3), a
   bundle document whose filename carries no `<BRD-KEY>` and therefore has no partition at all, or a
   prerequisite key **whose package this run copied in** that no partition in the bundle answers to,
   which is what a collapsed set of filenames looks like from the key set (§6.1) — stops with:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_DEAD_CITATION: <id-or-filename> in <bundle document> resolves to nothing — <what it was resolved against>. A reference the reviewer cannot follow is not fixed by deleting it: some sentence in the package assumed that id or that file, and the sentence is what has to change. Where it is a [BR#n] this slice does not claim, cited bare in a question, a held entry or a register record written before 3.7.0 — which let a question cite a delegated row as context with no qualifier — qualify it by hand as <PARENT-KEY> [BR#n], <PARENT-KEY> being this slice's parent:, and change nothing else in that sentence.`

   **A prerequisite Phase 2 carried with no package to copy in is not a hit**, and the discriminator
   is Phase 2's own carry — *whether a package of its own was found*. Its *BRD not found* and *no
   package on file; nothing to copy in* branches both leave a key that correctly answers to no
   partition, and both are ordinary; the guard is about a package that **is** in the bundle under
   flattened names. A reference naming such a prerequisite's own record is not a hit either — §6.2's
   relation 1 discharges a structured field another authority formats as a qualified cross-package
   reference, exactly because no partition could ever hold it.

   A class-4 `[DG#n]` whose `cites` resolves but names a different requirement than the citing
   finding's own claim (§6.2 relation 2) stops with:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_CITATION_MISMATCH: <DG-id> is class 4 and cites <CG-id>, whose claim names <requirement-a> where the citing finding's claim names <requirement-b> — the citation resolves, to a finding about a different requirement, which is the one failure a reviewer cannot detect by following it.`

   A corpus file holding record-shaped content that parses to zero ids of its class (§6.1) stops
   with the message below — and **only** such a file. One holding no record-shaped content at all is
   a legitimately empty corpus and passes: that is the ordinary state of a `design-grounding.md`
   written as a short note because design grounding was skipped, of a requirement defect log whose
   walk confirmed nothing, and of a `decisions.md` holding only its header line, as `/brd-interview`
   writes it where no round recorded a decision.
   `BRD_PACKAGE_CORPUS_UNREADABLE: <corpus file> holds record-shaped content but parsed to zero <class> ids — that is a parse failure, not an empty corpus, and reporting it as an absence would report every reference in the bundle as dead (workflows-core:grounding-format §2.1).`

   **A hit inside verbatim customer content or a customer-derived locator does not stop the run by
   itself** — it is reported and put to the operator on §6.3's *The operator's ruling*, whose *Hold
   the package* does stop it, with `BRD_PACKAGE_CUSTOMER_CONTENT_HELD`; or it is no hit at all,
   where `bundle-packaging.md` §6.3 says so — exactly as that section defines both sets and disposes
   of what lands in them. It is the same treatment the plugin-free scan gives those spans above, and
   for the identical reason: a `[BR#n]` or a filename visible in a customer's screenshot is theirs,
   not a citation, and the only repair left would falsify the record. Every other span's hit stays a
   hard stop.

9. **Run the set-resolution check**, per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §7,
   and stop on any hit. It is a third pass rather than a widening of rule 8, and the three hunt
   different failures: rule 7 finds a token the reviewer **cannot resolve**, rule 8 one they
   **resolve to the wrong thing**, and this one a **set restated wrongly** — every identifier
   resolving, every filename real, and the set they compose not being the set its source holds. It
   runs last because relation 2 needs the assembled bundle's own listing, and it is the only one that
   reaches the delivery note, which is deliberately not a bundle document.

   **Read §7's narrowings before running any relation, and read them all — the section states them
   per relation and carries no total, deliberately.** Every one was measured against assembled
   packages, and the obvious form of each fires on a correct bundle: a part writes an id **range**
   where a literal comparison sees two ids and reports the rest as omissions; a filter resolved from
   a part's prose rather than from the records' own fields over-selects; a manifest matcher fixed on
   one filename convention reports every document as missing; a manifest does not list itself and
   names images only sometimes; and a commit test demanding equality reports every correct delivery
   note as carrying no pin. **A count here would be a fourth wrong one** — this pointer has carried a
   wrong total three times, which is why it now cites the section instead of summarising it.

   A membership mismatch stops with:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_SET_MISMATCH: <part-or-document> restates <source>'s <filter> as <N> item(s) and the source holds <M> — <missing> are in the source and not here; <extra> are here and not in the source. A restatement is a copy; the sentence that composed it is what has to change, not the list.`

   A source side that comes up empty while the restatement is not stops with:
   `BRD_PACKAGE_SET_UNREADABLE: <source> yielded zero records under <filter> while <part-or-document> restates some — that is a read failure, not an empty set, and passing it would certify a restatement against nothing.`

**The bundle is committed** (D18), through the handoff below. That serves both delivery routes with
one artifact: a customer with repository access pulls it and needs nothing else, and everybody else
gets **one archive command**. **It is printed only where the archive is the route Phase 7 settled**
— on the repository route the customer pulls the bundle itself once the handoff's pull request
merges, and printing a command to build them a copy of it is the same defect this increment removed
from the prompt, one document further out.
On the archive route, print it in the delivery-route item (*Next steps*), with an absolute path:

```
cd "<BRD-dir>" && zip -r "<BRD-KEY>-bundle-<YYYYMMDD>.zip" "bundle-<YYYYMMDD>"
```

One command, in a format that opens on any desktop without installing anything, because the
population that cannot pull the repository is exactly the population that will not assemble an
archive command themselves.

**The committed copy is the permanent record of exactly what was sent.** It is what makes the
byte-identical property behind the one-new-file rule checkable months later: when a returned review
quotes a sentence, there is a committed copy of the document that sentence came from, at the version
the customer actually received — not a reconstruction from working documents that have moved on. The
acknowledged cost is a derived duplicate in the repository, and it is deliberate.

---

## Phase 9 — Handoff

The *Render the delivery note* phase has already presented `workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.3's
choice array, verbatim, and carried the answer — the one consent this run takes for its handoff,
taken there because the note's route depends on it — together with the `remote` value its
push-target probe set. This phase does not ask again, and does not probe again.

On the first choice, execute `handoff-to-main` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff handoff-to-main")`, §2) with `prefix: brd` (§2.9's
table, where `brd` is the prefix every `/brd-*` command shares), `feature_folder` as resolved in the
*Resolve inputs and gate the decided BRD* phase, `deliverable_paths` = every file this run wrote
under `<BRD-dir>` (`self-review-<YYYYMMDD>.md`, `customer-review-prompt-<YYYYMMDD>.md`,
`customer-delivery-note-<YYYYMMDD>.md`, every file under `bundle-<YYYYMMDD>/`, and `brd-link.md`
when this run added a prerequisite to it), `title: <BRD-KEY> Package for customer review
<YYYYMMDD>`, and `body_facts` = the degradation tier; the `[SR#n]` counts by disposition; the count
of `[C]` questions and open `[AS#n]` the prompt carries; every prerequisite named under *what could
still move*; and the repo→SHA table. Hand it the `remote` value Phase 7's probe set, which §2.1
has the entry point carry rather than probe a second time. Emit its §4.1 outcome line in the final
report.

**On the second or third choice `handoff-to-main` does not run, and the final report still carries
an outcome line**: §4.1's *Declined by the user* row, its `<artifacts>` the `deliverable_paths` set
above as that row counts it, and its `<next-phase-clause>` the **gated — stopping** one, which is
what the array's parenthetical promised (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.1, §4.3). Both options
decline the handoff and nothing else (§4.3, *What each option means*): nothing is branched,
committed or pushed, every file this run wrote stays in `<BRD-dir>` exactly as written, and none of
them is deleted or reverted. Either way the run goes on to *Next steps* and the emitter tail, which
commits this run's bounded session-artifact paths and never the deliverable. The route is the
archive one, settled by the *Render the delivery note* phase from this same answer, so the paragraph
below has nothing to read on either option.

**Then read that line against the route the *Render the delivery note* phase settled, and settle
what makes the note true. This phase settles it and prints it nowhere: it is printed in one place,
the delivery-route item the *Next steps* phase prints directly after the note and before its
offer.** On the archive route there is nothing to read: the note names what is attached, and it is
true as written. On the repository route the note, already written and among the files just
declared, sends the customer to pull the specs repository and open the bundle at its path — true
only once the bundle is on the default branch, which no outcome line reports:

- **The line records a push** — *Committed, pushed, PR opened*, *PR already existed* or *PR not
  opened* → the item names the branch it pushed and its pull request — on *PR not opened*, that one
  is still to be opened by hand — and says the note is true once that pull request merges, or,
  before then, for a customer told to check out that branch.
- **Any other line** — *Push failed*, *Gate failed* or another → the item says that nothing reached
  a ref a customer can pull, and what must happen before the note is sent: the declared files
  committed where nothing was, the branch pushed, and its pull request merged.
- **The line carries a *Declaration unaccounted for* clause** — `; <path> was declared but staged by
  nothing — this run put nothing on <branch> for it`, one clause per path (§4.1, whose causes §2.3
  step 4 names: a path nothing wrote, one git ignores, or a declaration git could not place) → the
  item names every such path and says the note is **not** true for it on any outcome: nothing was
  put on the branch for that file, so it is not in the bundle a customer pulls once the pull request
  merges, and no merge makes it so. That is settled per path and stands beside whichever bullet
  above the line itself took, never in place of it.

Do not rewrite the note under any outcome: it names the route the operator chose and the bundle's
path, and the condition is what the item printed beside it adds.

---

## Phase 10 — Next steps

**First, print the delivery note in full, and the delivery-route item directly after it.** The offer
below asks whether to send the note, so the operator reads both before answering rather than after.
The item states the route the *Render the delivery note* phase settled and why; on the archive
route, the archive command with an absolute path (*Assemble the bundle*); on the repository route,
that no archive command was produced because the customer pulls the committed bundle — so its
absence is never read as a step that failed — and the
condition the *Handoff* phase settled — the branch and the pull request whose merge the note waits
on, every path that phase's outcome line reported declared but staged by nothing, which no merge
makes the note true for, or, where it pushed nothing, what must happen first. **This item is the one
place that condition is printed**, and the Final report points back to it rather than repeating it.

The BRD-to-PRD route's next command is `/brd-reconcile`, which takes the returned review and turns
each confirmed answer into a `[CD#n]` — and it is offered, named for what it needs, because it
cannot run until a review actually comes back. The BRD route on `/create-prd`, which carries a decided,
reconciled BRD into a PRD, **ships** — and it is still not offered here, for a reason about this
state rather than about the plugin. This run packaged a BRD whose customer round is *open*: every
`[C]` it just rendered into the prompt, and every open `[AS#n]` it carried in, is a register item
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §3 forbids consuming downstream while
it is open, and `/create-prd` on the BRD route reads exactly that register as its seed. The answers are
frozen by `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` and by nothing here, so the reconciled BRD that route needs
is the state the *next* command leaves rather than this one, and `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s own
next-step phase is where the three BRD-route options are offered. The same holds for the BRD route
on `/create-ard` and `/specify`, which read the architecture- and implementation-altitude seeds
alongside the same register. So the honest offer is the state this run actually leaves behind:

```
choices: ["Stop here — the package is written and, if you handed it off, committed", "Send it — the delivery note is printed above, with whatever has to hold first where anything does", "Reconcile the review once it comes back — /product-workflows:brd-reconcile <BRD-KEY> @<review-file> <merge-clause>", "Package another BRD or slice"]
```

**What *Send it* means on the repository route, before the handoff's pull request merges.** The note
sends the customer to pull the specs repository, and a customer pulling its default branch finds no
bundle until that pull request merges; the delivery-route item printed above says which pull
request, every path the handoff declared and staged nothing for — which that merge does not put
there either, so the note stays untrue for it — and, where the handoff pushed nothing, what must
happen first. So *Send it* there means send once that condition holds — or send now with the
branch named beside the note, for a customer who will check that branch out. On the archive route it
means send now, the archive attached.

**No option carries a `(Recommended)` marker, and that omission is deliberate**, per the
`When no option is safe to recommend` guidance in
`workflows-core:escalation-rules`: whether to send is a delivery judgement this
command has no basis for — a package shipped at the documents-only tier with three `accepted-risk`
findings may be exactly right to send today or exactly right to hold, and only the operator knows
which. The reason is stated here, beside the list, rather than folded into a conditional marker the
orchestrator would then have to evaluate.

Say plainly what remains, per `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "next-phase-offer")` — names only,
never behaviour a command of its own owns: the round holding each `[C]` stays open until the
customer's answer comes back and `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` records it, and what happens between
this run and that one is not the plugin's to do — the package has to reach a customer and the
customer has to answer.

### Context hygiene

The resume pointer is written in the terminal cost phase, per
`workflows-core:session-hygiene` §1. Re-packaging the same BRD after a
correction? → run **`/compact`**. Moving to a different BRD or slice? → run **`/clear`**. Guidance
only — nothing is auto-run.

---

## Phase 11 — Session maintenance, feedback & cost

Terminal phase — runs after *Next steps*, and NEVER interrupts an earlier phase.

**Capture-at-block invariant.** If an EARLIER phase halts on a plugin / skill / command / reference
gap, `emit-block` (`workflows-core:feedback-emission`) fires at that halt before escalating. Six of
this command's stops **do** qualify and are the reason the invariant is named here:
`BRD_PACKAGE_SCHEMA_BOUNDARY`, `BRD_PACKAGE_SCHEMA_EXAMPLE_ID` and `BRD_PACKAGE_PROMPT_LEAK` are all
reference-integrity gaps — a rendered authority whose boundary moved, a rendered authority carrying
an example identifier with a number in it, and a package artifact carrying a citation that should
never have been written into it; `BRD_PACKAGE_CORPUS_UNREADABLE` and `BRD_PACKAGE_SET_UNREADABLE`
are record-integrity gaps — each is, by its own text, this command's parse or read of the plugin's
own records failing on content that is there, which no sentence in the package can fix; and
`BRD_PACKAGE_REVIEW_UNACCOUNTED` is an agent-contract gap, a dispatch this command owns whose agent
broke its return contract twice, the rule `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` applies to its own
`BRD_RECONCILE_READER_CONTRACT`. **Every other stop fails that test and is classified by it, never
by a list**: each reports the operator's own argument, the tree or the environment, a gate working,
the operator's own ruling, or a defect in the package's own content that a sentence in it has to
change to fix — as a review BLOCK is a defect in the work and not in the plugin. Among them: a
missing or malformed key, an unresolved BRD, a resolved root BRD, a resolved Epic folder
(`BRD_PACKAGE_EPIC_LEVEL`), an idea-route PRD folder
(`BRD_PACKAGE_NOT_A_SLICE`), an ungated, absent or unmerged
register or round record, a shipped question set or log on no ref (`BRD_PACKAGE_SHIPPED_NOT_HANDED_OFF`),
a round a standing re-decision names and no record holds
(`BRD_PACKAGE_ROUND_NOT_RECORDED`), a folder holding a torn write (`BRD_PACKAGE_TORN_WRITES`), a
round record on disk that cannot be read (`BRD_PACKAGE_ROUND_UNREADABLE`), an unsettled or uninterviewed round, nothing to review, a bundle directory
that already exists, and an unset `$SPECS_PATH` are environment or sequencing halts; the other
bundle-integrity checks (`BRD_PACKAGE_DEAD_CITATION`, `BRD_PACKAGE_CITATION_MISMATCH`,
`BRD_PACKAGE_SET_MISMATCH`) report what the assembled bundle and the records it was built from hold;
`BRD_PACKAGE_UNDISPOSED` is the gate working; and `BRD_PACKAGE_CUSTOMER_CONTENT_HELD` is the
operator's own ruling on the customer's words.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (subagent_type: "workflows-core:impl-maintenance", model:
   `<detection_model>`) with a compact handoff: command `/brd-package`; what was produced (the
   self-review, the prompt, the delivery note, the bundle); key events (the tier assigned and why,
   the `[SR#n]` dispositions, a re-dispatch after a `fixed` correction, a prompt-leak stop, a
   prerequisite with no package on file — or "none"); workarounds; test result N/A; project root =
   the BRD folder.
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "feedback-emission emit-auto")` and call its `emit-auto` entry point (§6)
   with the Lessons Learned report, `command: /brd-package`, the run's `key` (the `<BRD-KEY>`),
   `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Surface the persisted path (or "no
   plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted").
3. **Session cost (ALWAYS runs).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "cost-emission emit-cost")` and call its `emit-cost` entry point with `command: /brd-package`, `phase: brd-to-prd`, `role: pm`, the
   run's `key`, `source`, and `plugin_version`. Surface the persisted path (or the report-only
   notice).
4. **Write the resume pointer.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "session-hygiene")` and, per its §1, write/overwrite `<BRD-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` now — after the cost entry, before the commit
   step below. Redact per §1. Silent.
5. **Commit session artifacts (terminal).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git commit-artifacts")` and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — the LAST action of the run. Stages ONLY the §2.1 bounded artifact paths inside
   `$SPECS_PATH`, commits `<BRD-KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (/brd-package)` with no
   `Co-Authored-By` trailer, and pushes to the branch the handoff phase created. NEVER touches a code
   repo, a docs repo, or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository; NEVER force-pushes; NEVER fails the
   run; skips entirely when the run carries `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting that notice.
   Hold its §6 outcome line for the final report.

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits the deliverable (git for the deliverable is
offered in the *Render the delivery note* phase and executed only in the handoff phase), and NEVER
writes into a code/docs repo, or the current working directory, where it is not the specs
repository; no user name is ever written.

---

## Final report

Report: the BRD folder and which level it sits at; the classification and model routing (+ any Opus
degradation, named again here because a self-review that ran on a weaker model is a weaker gate);
**the degradation tier**, and the sentence it obliges the customer's own review to carry; **every
`[SR#n]` with its disposition**, and every `- **Re-escalates:**` line written, grouped by
disposition, with the `accepted-risk` ones listed in
full because those are the ones the customer will read; whether a second reviewer pass ran after a
`fixed` correction and what it added; the counts the prompt carries — `[C]` questions, open
`[AS#n]`, `escalated-to-customer` findings, and the `[CDF#n]` counts parts 6, 8 and 11 each carry,
`in-scope`, `conditional` and `out-of-scope` respectively; **every prerequisite named under *what
could still move***, with whether it resolved, whether its decisions are customer-reviewed, and whether a
package of its own was copied in; every artifact written, by path — the self-review, the customer
prompt, the delivery note and the bundle, and `brd-link.md` where this run added a prerequisite to
it; **the citation check's
outcome** — how many identifier references resolved, across how many source packages, how many
named another BRD and were discharged, and every hit inside verbatim customer content or a
customer-derived locator — this check's and the plugin-free scan's alike — that the operator was
asked to rule on, under the *Customer content:* outcome line `bundle-packaging.md` §6.3's *The
operator's ruling* fixes and grouped as that section fixes, **or `Customer content: none`**; **the
delivery note and its delivery-route item** — both printed at *Next steps*, before that phase's
offer, and named here rather than repeated, so the condition the item carries is printed once; the
feedback + cost paths; the `Phase handoff:` outcome line
(`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.1); the `Specs repo:` outcome line
(`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §6); the next-step recommendation; and — before the ledger line —
the **repo→SHA table**:

```
baselines: <repo> @ <commit> (<how it was verified>)
           <repo> @ <commit> (<how it was verified>)
```

One row per repository in `grounding/baselines.md`, printed here as well as in the prompt because it
is what a reader of this run's own output needs in order to answer "what was this package pinned
to?" without opening the bundle. No repository on file → one line saying so, and naming the
documents-only tier it forced.

End with the ledger line, read fresh from the (unmodified-by-this-run) `coverage-ledger.md`, exactly
per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §6:

```
ledger: <N> requirements — <covered> covered, <deferred> deferred, <rejected> rejected, <unallocated> unallocated, <unresolved> unresolved (<delegated> delegated, <not-built> not built)
```

`/brd-package` never changes a ledger disposition — the line simply reports where allocation stands.
**Reporting it reads one ledger per `covered-by` row**, one hop, from the working tree via
`resolve-address` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3), per `coverage-ledger-format.md` §6.1 — this run always stands on a slice
(step 6 already confirmed `decisions.md` is on main, and every command that writes that file —
`/brd-interview`, `/create-prd` (an `[AS#n]`, and its own `consumed_by` stamps), `/brd-reconcile`, and the
`consumed_by` stamps of `/create-ard` and `/specify` — itself refuses to run on a root), so that is always a sibling or the parent
(§3); a ledger that cannot be
read there contributes `unresolved`, never `covered` (§6.2). A slice does **not** always reach this with
nothing to resolve. `covered-by` is legal on a slice (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3), where it
names a sibling under the same parent or that parent and marks an **orphan row** — a ledger row for a `[BR#n]` this slice no longer claims, reached by either of the first two of §2's routes, the only two that write `covered-by`: the parent's walk withdrawing a claim that was never more than provisional, or a re-cut moving a claim the slice had committed to and then recorded it would not build (§3.2). Those rows are resolved one hop exactly like a parent's
delegated rows, so a slice reports zero delegated only when its parent withdrew none of its
claims.
