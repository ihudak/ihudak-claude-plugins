# workflows-core — plugin facts, model-routing callers, shared authorities, workflow map

Loaded when a file under `plugins/workflows-core/`, or any plugin's command or agent file, is read: the model-routing callers, the consumer sets of the core authorities below and the core agents' caller lines change when a command or agent in another plugin does. Repo-wide rules are in `CLAUDE.md`; evidence is in `docs/maintainers/rationale.md`.

Split out to keep this file under 20,000 characters: the git authorities (`specs-repo-git`, `phase-handoff`, `read-only-repos`) and the specs-repo git invariants → `.claude/rules/workflows-core-git.md`, which also loads with every command, reference and agent file, since every command that writes into `$SPECS_PATH` runs those entry points and its references and agents invoke them. `instruction-file-maintenance` binds hand edits to `CLAUDE.md` and is stated there, in § Editing discipline.

## Plugin facts

`workflows-core` carries twenty-nine reference files, five agents (`code-scanner`, `doc-fixer`, `docs-grounder`, `frame-describer`, `impl-maintenance`), two bundled skills (`model-routing` and the `reference` loader), the cost and status-line scripts under `scripts/`, and the six family-meta commands `CLAUDE.md` § Active plugins names.

It ships two hooks — `notify-done` and `test-notify`, both session-wide rather than command-scoped, which is why they live in `workflows-core`: every family plugin declares `workflows-core`, so one copy serves everyone.

The host installs `workflows-core` alongside any of the three family plugins that name it, and every pipeline command loads at least one core reference in its first phase — the reason the tier-1 dependency rule is what the family wants.

## Docs tree

`workflows-core` carries 16 pages — `docs/README.md` (the index), `getting-started.md`, `workflow.md` and `roles-and-phases.md`, 6 command pages under `docs/commands/` and 6 reference pages under `docs/reference/`.

## Model routing reference

`plugins/workflows-core/references/model-routing/classification.md` is the
**single source of truth** for:

- Task complexity classification (`SIMPLE` / `MODERATE` / `SIGNIFICANT` /
  `HIGH-RISK`)
- The model fallback chain (Opus 5.5 → 5 → 4.8 → 4.7 → 4.6 → Sonnet 5 → Sonnet 4.6 → Sonnet 4.5)
- The mandatory Opus code-review checklist
- The `model_routing` YAML handoff block shared between commands and agents
- The `phase: verify-resume` protocol for review-gated verification
- The large-input scan fan-out policy (§8): the input-shape trigger, the `resolved-folder read → parallel code-scanner (cap 4) → Opus synthesis` pattern, the SIGNIFICANT floor it imposes, and §8.5's opt-in seeded second round with its rule that an unresolved theme is named, never flattened into a gap ([why](../../docs/maintainers/rationale.md#model-routing-fan-out))

## Model routing callers

Twenty-six commands invoke the `workflows-core:model-routing` skill and must load and follow `plugins/workflows-core/references/model-routing/classification.md` at the start of every invocation: `/design`, `/implement`, `/ready`, `/upgrade`, `/vuln` — all five of `dev-workflows`'s — `/idea`, `/create-prd`, `/update-prd`, `/create-ard`, `/specify`, `/epics`, `/brd-intake`, `/prd-ground`, `/brd-split`, `/brd-interview`, `/brd-package`, `/brd-reconcile`, `/prd-proposal`, `/brd-proposal` — all fourteen of `product-workflows`'s — plus six of `docs-workflows`'s seven (`/document`, `/docs-profile`, `/release-notes`, `/docs-init`, `/docs-brand`, `/docs-audit`) and `workflows-core`'s own `/frames`. The remaining utility commands (`/docs-serve`, `/feedback`, `/prompt`, `/prompt-brainstorm`, `/prompt-grill-me`, `/statusline` — one of `docs-workflows`'s seven and five of `workflows-core`'s six) are exempt — `/docs-serve` starts a process and reports a URL, with no task to classify, and `/feedback` names `model-routing` only as one of its friction categories, which is not a load. An agent that reads a field of the `model_routing` block receives it in its prompt — its handoff file declares the input, and §4's list is the authority; every other agent is sent none and has its tier pinned by its own frontmatter or by the dispatch's `model:` argument. No agent re-reads it for routing; `code-review` and `risk-planner` load it for its criteria (`grep -ln 'args: "model-routing' plugins/*/agents/*.md`).

## Authorities

`plugins/workflows-core/references/source-truth.md` is the **single source of truth** for the Implementation-vs-Description discrepancy-escalation protocol. It is consulted by `doc-planner`, `doc-writer`, `doc-reviewer`, `release-notes-writer`, `risk-planner` and `/release-notes`, which runs the discrepancy escalation itself to verify user-visible claims (option lists, UI labels, menu paths, defaults, counts, mode names) against the shipped source code, and defines the escalation protocol when a written description and the source disagree (Phase 5.8 in `/document` (keyed mode)).

`plugins/workflows-core/references/prose-formatting.md` is the **single source of truth** for output line-wrapping — never hard-wrap prose; write each paragraph/prose block as one unbroken line, so Obsidian and IntelliJ Idea soft-wrap it for reading and a straight copy-paste into a tracker, a review tool or a chat needs no manual cleanup. Consumed by every authoring command/agent that writes prose — `grep -l prose-formatting plugins/*/commands/*.md plugins/*/agents/*.md` lists them. ([why](../../docs/maintainers/rationale.md#recipe-returns-wrong-answer))

`plugins/workflows-core/references/implementation-format.md` is the **single source of truth** for the append-only `implementation.md` record `/implement` writes on a keyed run (refs only, never a summary — a ref cannot drift and a description can), for where it lives (the folder of the unit implemented: an Epic's, or the PRD folder's for a broad PRD-level slice), for the commit convention whose subject ends with `[<key>]` — the key of the unit implemented, an Epic's even where `/implement` chose it under a PRD address — and for the two-source read `/document` and `/release-notes` perform over that record plus a `git log --grep` scan for the keys and `workitem_key`s of the records the read takes (an Epic's, or at PRD level the PRD's and every Epic's), each matched only as a whole key, a ref two records name counted once, and — for `/release-notes` — the note boundary, which is the set of commits an earlier note read and never a date, binding the scan as it binds the blocks. **All three code-changing commands commit into a code repository and write a compliant subject** — `code-handoff.md` made the commit prompt-free — so the convention is *also* documented in `docs/reference/commit-convention.md` for the people whose commits the scan must find and who are not running the plugin at all. The scan searches for tokens the run already holds and never extracts one from a commit message.

`plugins/workflows-core/references/doc-structure-conventions.md` is the **single source of truth** for three product-docs authoring conventions: the traceability boundary (a rendered page carries no key, PR URL, or provenance comment — that lives in the commit message and the run handoff only), callout scope and adjacency (a callout sits with the option it qualifies, in the lead-in only when it spans the whole set), and component-pattern fidelity (reuse an area's established content component for a recurring content shape instead of an ad-hoc structure). Consumed by `/document` and `/epics`, and by `doc-planner`, `doc-writer`, and `doc-reviewer`.

`plugins/workflows-core/references/finding-triage.md` is the **single source of truth** for the step between a reviewer's findings and a fixer's edits — run by the **orchestrator**, never by the fixer, because a dismissal must not sit at a weaker station than the Opus reviewer that produced the finding. It owns the attachment rule (wherever a reasoned-claim producer feeds a fixer: `code-review` → `review-fixer` in `/implement` / `/vuln` / `/upgrade`, `doc-reviewer` → `doc-fixer` in `/document` keyed mode, `epic-reviewer` → `doc-fixer` in `/epics`, `docs-scaffold-reviewer` → the orchestrator itself in `/docs-init` and a standalone `/docs-brand`, and `docs-audit-reviewer` → the orchestrator itself in `/docs-audit`, which have no fixer agent (D25) and apply survivors by direct edit, and `proposal-reviewer` → the orchestrator itself in `/prd-proposal` and `/brd-proposal`, which have no delegated writer and fix surviving BLOCKERs inline; **never** a style checker → `doc-fixer`, and where a command dispatches a fixer more than once it attaches to the reviewer-fed dispatch only), the three-step process (verify each finding's own claimed consequence at the location it names, keep or dismiss, record every dismissal with a reason that disposes of that finding's own claim — there is no silent-drop disposition), the patch gate (auto-fix only a defect that actually occurs, missing coverage for a specific case, or a broken gate/convention — never a state nothing reaches, and never a fix that guards state the finding did not demonstrate), the reporting contract (findings reviewed, survivors, and every dismissal with its reason — a triage that reports only survivors is indistinguishable from a reviewer that found less), and the disposition when triage empties the survivor set (never dispatch a fixer with nothing to apply, never run the unresolved-BLOCKER escalation on a refuted BLOCKER, and never silently promote a non-PASS verdict — the user settles a verdict its own findings no longer support). Consumed by `/implement`, `/vuln`, `/upgrade`, `/document` (keyed mode), `/epics`, `/docs-init`, `/docs-brand` (standalone — an `--inline` run's diff is triaged inside `/docs-init`'s), `/docs-audit`, `/prd-proposal` and `/brd-proposal`, and by `review-fixer` and `doc-fixer` for the patch gate; `docs-scaffold-reviewer`, `docs-audit-reviewer` and `proposal-reviewer` cite it to say their caller triages what they return. Re-derive the set with `grep -l finding-triage plugins/*/commands/*.md plugins/*/agents/*.md`, which returns exactly the commands and agents named here.

## Workflow map

The `workflows-core` command's line of the family workflow map, the logging commands' note, and the caller lines of the agents `plugins/workflows-core/agents/` ships. In the `## Workflow map` blocks of `.claude/rules/*.md`, agents marked `(workflows-core)`, `(docs-workflows)`, or `(product-workflows)` ship from a plugin other than `dev-workflows`, invoked as `subagent_type: "<plugin>:<agent>"` like every other dispatch in the family.

```
/frames (core)       → [resolve-address on the specs tree — any kind: design/ is reserved in BRD, PRD and Epic folders] → list each design/<frame-set>/ → [frame-describer×1 per set, cap 40 frames per run] → rebuild each index.md per `workflows-core:grounding-format` §6.2 (preserve verbatim / append / drop / one of **two** placeholders — `_no description on record_` where the run never looked, which the next run retries, and `_could not be read: <reason>_` where the describer looked and failed, which it does not, because retrying a frame that cannot be read spends budget a reachable one would have used and never converges) → [handoff-to-main: each index.md, one literal path] → impl-maintenance → commit-artifacts   (indexing only: no design-grounder, no [DG#n], no verifier)
                      └── doc-fixer (workflows-core)            (used by /document, /epics)
                      └── code-scanner (workflows-core)         (used by /epics, /implement multi-source fan-out, /create-ard, /specify, /design, /idea, /docs-audit)
                      └── frame-describer (workflows-core)      (used by /frames)
                      └── docs-grounder (workflows-core)        (used by /idea, /create-prd, /update-prd, /create-ard, /specify, /epics, /release-notes, /brd-intake, /prd-ground)
                      └── impl-maintenance (workflows-core)     (used by 25 of the 32 commands — all but /docs-profile, /docs-serve, /statusline, /feedback, /prompt, /prompt-brainstorm and /prompt-grill-me)
```

`/feedback`, `/prompt`, `/prompt-brainstorm`, and `/prompt-grill-me` run `specs-preflight` and `commit-artifacts` like every other command that writes into `$SPECS_PATH` (`CLAUDE.md` § Hard constraints), and have no line of their own in the workflow map because they are single-purpose logging commands rather than pipelines. All four emit a session-cost entry, inheriting the phase and role of whatever they are correcting (`workflows-core:cost-emission` §7) — but `/prompt-brainstorm` and `/prompt-grill-me` cede the session before they could write one, so each records its labels and the next cost-emitting run in the session writes the entry on its behalf, splitting its own window at the transcript's record of where that run began (§13). In `/prompt-brainstorm` and `/prompt-grill-me` the terminal step runs immediately before their Phase 3, which cedes the session (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §4).
