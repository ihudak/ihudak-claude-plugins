# Fires on every message submission. Matches the one command this plugin ships
# that injects context, /epics — bare or prefixed with this plugin's own
# namespace (e.g. /product-workflows:epics) — and routes it:
#   • /epics                            → $SPECS_PATH + $REPOS_PATH default
#                                         + git branch only if cwd is inside
#                                         a git repo (no model-routing, no full
#                                         status/log, no directory listing). It
#                                         is keyed and resolves its own
#                                         address or specs-directory argument
#                                         via resolve-address.
#
# emit_specs_context surfaces $SPECS_PATH alongside $REPOS_PATH. The function
# is already byte-identical across dev-workflows and docs-workflows (verified
# by diff); this is the third copy, following established precedent rather
# than a new design decision. Sharing it is not available: a hook runs as
# `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/<script>`, and that variable resolves to
# the reading plugin, so a hook cannot source a sibling plugin's file — a
# dependency grants installation, never file access.
#
# Two sibling plugins each ship a hook of this name, one regex apiece:
# dev-workflows covers /implement, /vuln and /upgrade; docs-workflows covers
# /document and /release-notes. A UserPromptSubmit hook fires whichever
# plugin ships it, so all three run on every prompt. Disjointness holds two
# ways at once: the three bare-command alternations share no command name
# across the three plugins, and the optional plugin-name prefix each regex
# now also accepts is a literal, distinct string per plugin — so no single
# prompt can match more than one of the three.
#
# Exits immediately (near-zero overhead) if the message doesn't match.
# Always exits 0 — must never block Claude.

# Guard: if python3 is not available, skip silently
command -v python3 &>/dev/null || exit 0

# Read prompt from stdin JSON. Claude Code's UserPromptSubmit payload uses the
# key "prompt"; hookify's rule engine also accepts "user_prompt". Try all three
# known names for robustness across versions.
