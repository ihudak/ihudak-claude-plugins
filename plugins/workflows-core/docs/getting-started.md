# Getting started

Add the marketplace, then install this plugin:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ihudak/ihudak-claude-plugins
claude plugin install workflows-core@ihudak-plugins
```

To pick up later changes:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update ihudak-plugins
claude plugin update workflows-core@ihudak-plugins
```

**Both steps are needed, and the second is the one that changes what runs.** `marketplace update` refreshes the catalogue — what the marketplace advertises — while an already-installed plugin stays at the version you installed. `claude plugin update` upgrades it, and **requires restarting Claude Code to apply.** The interactive `/plugins` interface does the same with a picker. This page used to say the first line alone was enough; it is not, and the symptom is quiet — `claude plugins list` keeps reporting the old version while the catalogue advertises the new one.

## What this plugin is

`workflows-core` is the shared foundation of the `dev-workflows` plugin family. Most of what it ships is not a command: it is the reference corpus the sibling plugins read — `dev-workflows`, `product-workflows`, and `docs-workflows` all declare it as a dependency — the `model-routing` skill every pipeline command loads at its classification step, and five agents any of them may dispatch. If you have installed a plugin from that family, you want this one installed too.

It does ship six commands of its own, and one of them is worth running first — see below.

## What you set on your machine

`workflows-core` reads five environment variables, and every one of them is read by a reference this plugin ships rather than by a command of its own. One is required for anything in the family to have somewhere to write (`SPECS_PATH`); the rest are optional and each degrades to a documented default or a silent skip. [Environment](reference/environment.md) has the exact defaults and failure behaviour.

### `SPECS_PATH`

The **shared, team-visible store for the AI-authored documents** and for every run's bookkeeping — cost entries, session feedback, follow-ups. It has no default: nothing is guessed, and with it unset those entries degrade to report-only rather than being written somewhere else.

### `REPOS_PATH`

Where your code clones live — one directory, or a colon-separated list of them. It has a sensible built-in default, so most readers never need to set it. `code-scanner` resolves repositories under it.

### `DOCS_PATH`

A **read-only** clone of your shipped product documentation, used by `docs-grounder` to ground a draft against what is already published. Never written to; every miss is a silent, non-blocking skip.

### `GIT_USER_INITIALS`

Your branch identifier. Branch naming is repo-rule-first: where the target repo's own documented convention has a name-or-initials segment, this fills it; where it does not, the variable is simply unused for that repo.

### `DEV_WORKFLOWS_COST_PRICES`

An optional path to your own price table, overriding the bundled `references/cost-prices.yaml` that session-cost reporting prices tokens against. It is the variable of the five you are least likely ever to set — the bundled defaults are used until you do. It keeps its original name so a setting already exported on a working machine is not silently ignored.

## Install the status line

**Worth doing before your first real run.** Two things come out of it.

The visible half is a permanent multi-line status line at the bottom of your terminal — session identity, git state, context usage, running cost, tokens, and rate limits — so you can see a long command spending your budget while it spends it.

The half you don't see is the **cost cross-check**: Claude Code's own reported cost, captured per render, which the cost phase differences into a per-invocation delta. Where that disagrees with the computed figure, the gap is the signal that the bundled price table has drifted. See [Session cost](reference/session-cost.md).

```
/workflows-core:statusline
```

Claude Code ships its own built-in `/statusline` command, so typing the bare form reaches that instead of this plugin's — always use the qualified form.

## The other five commands

Four of them are how you tell the plugin family it got something wrong: [`/feedback`](commands/feedback.md) logs a note in your own words, while [`/prompt`](commands/prompt.md), [`/prompt-brainstorm`](commands/prompt-brainstorm.md) and [`/prompt-grill-me`](commands/prompt-grill-me.md) capture a correction you just made and then act on it — directly, by redesigning it, or by grilling it. The fifth, [`/frames`](commands/frames.md), rebuilds the index an exported design frame set must carry before anything else can read it.

See the [documentation index](README.md) for everything else, including the [Workflow overview](workflow.md).
