description: Runs the docs repo's project-configured prose linter (e.g. Vale) on files written by `/document` (keyed mode, or direct mode) AND also runs prose-style-checker — a complementary semantic / cross-page-consistency pass beside a primary linter, and the SOLE check on a repository that configures none. Merges and dedupes both finding sets into the doc-reviewer / doc-fixer schema. Detects tooling (Vale, project lint script, markdownlint, remark) from the repo; does not embed any specific style guide. Model tier assigned by the caller per the model-routing policy (no fixed pin).

Run the docs repo's project-configured prose linter on a set of files, and ALSO run `prose-style-checker`: a complementary semantic / cross-page-consistency pass where a primary linter produced a result, and the SOLE check where every rung failed or the repository configures none. The merge rules below turn on which of those two roles it took. Merge and dedupe their findings into a single reviewer finding schema.

Invoked from `/document` (keyed mode, Phase 6.4) and `/document` (direct mode, Phase 3.5), after the files are written and before `doc-reviewer`. Catching corporate-style issues locally frees the doc-reviewer (Opus) to spend its attention budget on correctness and completeness rather than prose policing, and surfaces before the PR what the repository's own style rules would flag on it.

## Rationale

Corporate style guides (Microsoft, Google, and various organisation-specific variants) are encoded as Vale style packages maintained by each organisation's docs team, not by this plugin. The docs repo references them via `.vale.ini` (`BasedOnStyles = …`). Re-encoding or crawling the corporate style-guide site would duplicate the canonical source and drift. Wrapping the repo's existing tooling means the local check applies the repository's own rules — for Vale, its own configuration and none of the machine's (step 1 says how) — so a finding here is one those rules raise. It is not a guarantee that CI reports the same: CI may pin another Vale release or sync other package versions, lint other files, pass flags of its own, or run no linter at all.

**Why ALSO run `prose-style-checker` when a primary linter is available** (since v1.7.1): empirical verification showed the two are **complementary, not overlapping**:

| Class of finding | Vale catches | `prose-style-checker` catches |
|---|---|---|
| Lexical (banned words, contractions, hyphens) | ✅ at scale | partial |
| Em-dash spacing, sentence length | ✅ | ✅ |
| Missing frontmatter fields (`navigation:`, title length) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Engineer jargon (`latest-minus-one`, `LTS-1`) | ❌ no rule | ✅ MAJOR |
| Cross-page label consistency (e.g. "Settings > Updates" across N pages) | ❌ | ✅ MAJOR |
| Subject-verb agreement, misplaced modifier | ❌ | ✅ MINOR |
| Plural/singular UI-label mismatch (`update window` vs `update windows`) | ❌ | ✅ MAJOR |

Running ONLY the primary linter (because it exists) misses the semantic / cross-page class. Running ONLY `prose-style-checker` duplicates work and is slower at lexical. Chaining both — primary first, `prose-style-checker` complementary — covers both classes without rework.

## Inputs

```yaml
repo_root: <absolute path to the docs repo root>
site_root: <OPTIONAL. Absolute path of the directory the caller resolved the docs site to, where it lies
            below repo_root — a monorepo's website/. Omitted otherwise.>
files:     [<absolute paths of files written in Phase 6.3 (or Phase 3 for direct mode)>]
spaces:    # OPTIONAL. Supplied by the caller from profile.spaces + profile.commands.per_space.
  - id:           <space id>
    content_root: <path relative to repo_root, e.g. self-hosted/_content>
    lint:         <the space's lint command, e.g. "pnpm self-hosted:lint">
```

Refuse to run without `repo_root` and at least one entry in `files`. `spaces` is optional: when absent
or empty, run the whole-repo detection ladder below unchanged.

**Where each rung looks, and where it runs.** A site below the top level keeps its own Vale configuration,
`package.json` and lint configuration beside itself or in a directory above it — a `site_root` of
`website/docs` finds a `website/.vale.ini` one level up — and not necessarily at `repo_root`. So
where the caller passes `site_root`, each rung below looks for its configuration in each directory
from `site_root` up to `repo_root`, the nearest first — the order Vale's own search takes, starting
where Vale runs and climbing — and runs from the directory where it found it; without `site_root`
it looks in `repo_root` alone. The commands the profile records — step 2's per-space `lint` — run from
`repo_root`, where every profile command runs. Your Bash tool starts every call in the session's
directory, which need not be the docs repository, and a `cd` does not persist between calls, so each
command below runs as one subshell `(builtin cd "<that directory>" >/dev/null && …)` inside a single Bash
call — `builtin cd`, its output discarded, since your Bash tool's shell carries the user's shell
functions and aliases, and a `cd` of theirs would otherwise run in its place and could print into
the output you parse.

## Detection order (a ladder — the first rung that SUCCEEDS sets the PRIMARY pass)

> **Hard rule before anything else — this is a ladder, not a first-match switch.** A failure at step
> *N* continues to step *N+1*. The first step that **succeeds** sets `primary_linter`; a step that is
> detected but fails (missing binary, non-zero exit with no parseable output, timeout) is recorded in
> `primary_attempts` and the ladder moves on. Step 5 (`prose-style-checker`) is reached after steps 1–4
> have each been tried — never as an escape hatch from the first one. Only return `ERROR` if every
> primary rung failed or was never detected AND `prose-style-checker` also failed.
>
> This matters concretely: `example-docs` has both a `.vale.ini` (step 1) and `pnpm docs:lint`
> / `pnpm self-hosted:lint` scripts (step 2). When `vale` is not installed, step 2 is the linter CI will
> actually run, and abandoning it because step 1 was *detected* leaves the run with no repo linter at
> all.

1. **Vale via its configuration file** — if a file of one of the five names Vale reads its configuration from (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/toolchain-preflight.md` §2, source 2) exists in one of those directories — from `site_root` (where passed) up to `repo_root`, the nearest first — run `vale --output=JSON <files>` from the nearest directory holding one, in the form that same section gives for every Vale run in this plugin (**How this plugin runs Vale**), which the file found decides: one form where it sets `StylesPath` and another where it sets none. `.vale.ini` is only the commonest of the five, so a test for it alone misses a site whose configuration is `_vale.ini` and records that no linter is configured. Vale looks for its configuration in the directory it runs in and then in each directory above it, uses the first it finds — within one directory, the first of the five names in that section's order — and never looks beside the files. Run from the directory holding the site's configuration, it reads that one. Run from a directory outside that one's tree — the session's, say — it reads the first configuration at or above that directory instead, which may be another repository's; where there is none, it stops with `E100 [.vale.ini not found]`. **Either form reads the repository's own configuration and none of the machine's** — no global Vale configuration, no `VALE_CONFIG_PATH` — and keeps the styles that configuration reads: a configuration that sets no `StylesPath` keeps its synced packages and custom styles in Vale's default StylesPath, which `--no-global` alone would drop, failing this rung with `E100 … does not exist on StylesPath` on a configuration that lints. That section says why each part of both forms is there. Parse the JSON into finding records. Set `primary_linter: vale`. **On non-zero exit / missing binary → record the attempt in `primary_attempts` and continue to step 2.**

2. **Project-specific lint script** — when the caller supplied `spaces`, determine which spaces own the input `files` by matching each file's path against each space's `content_root` prefix, and run **that space's `lint` command** from `repo_root`, where every command the profile records runs — `(builtin cd "<repo_root>" >/dev/null && <lint>)` — for every space owning at least one file (a Self-hosted-only file set runs `pnpm self-hosted:lint`, not the Cloud linter). Record one `primary_attempts` entry per space-scoped command. The rung succeeds only if EVERY owning space's command produced parseable output; if any one of them fails, record each attempt separately and continue the ladder to step 3 for the whole file set (never re-lint a partial subset — a mixed pass is not a primary pass). On success set `primary_linter` to `per-space:` followed by every owning space id in `spaces` order joined by `+` — one owning space gives `per-space:self-hosted`, two give `per-space:cloud+self-hosted` — and set `primary_command` to every command that ran, joined by `; ` **in that same `spaces` order**, so the pair always describes exactly what executed and two runs over the same outcome produce identical strings. When `spaces` is absent or no space matches, fall back to the whole-repo behaviour: take the first `package.json` — in each directory from `site_root` up to `repo_root`, the nearest first, where `site_root` is passed; in `repo_root` otherwise — that has a script matching `*:lint` or `lint:*` that covers markdown (e.g. `docs:lint`, `site:lint`, `lint:md`), and run that script from the directory holding it, `(builtin cd "<that directory>" >/dev/null && <runner> run <script>)`. Parse stderr/stdout for line-level violations. If the script lints the whole tree, filter violations to the target files only. Set `primary_linter: yarn:<script>` or `npm:<script>`. **On failure → record the attempt in `primary_attempts` and continue to step 3.** When `spaces` is supplied and SOME input files match no space's `content_root`, run each owning space's command as above **and additionally run the whole-repo fallback command below over the unmatched files**, recording it as its own `primary_attempts` entry with the linter value that fallback produces (`yarn:<script>` / `npm:<script>` / `pnpm:<script>`). Every input file must be covered by exactly one executed command. If no whole-repo fallback exists, this rung has not covered its inputs: record the space-scoped attempts, treat the rung as failed, and continue the ladder to step 3 — never report a pass over files nothing linted.

3. **Generic markdown linter** — if `.markdownlint.json(c)` or `.remarkrc*` exists in one of the directories from `site_root` (where passed) up to `repo_root`, the nearest first, AND the corresponding binary is on PATH, run it on the target files from the directory holding that configuration. Set `primary_linter: markdownlint` or `primary_linter: remark`. **On failure → record the attempt in `primary_attempts` and continue to step 4.**

4. **No primary pass succeeded** — either no project-level linter was detected at all, or every rung that was detected has been tried and failed (each recorded in `primary_attempts`). Go to step 5. Which role `prose-style-checker` takes depends on which of those two happened, and step 5's own bullets decide it: SOLE when nothing was ever detected, FALLBACK when rungs were tried and failed. When no rung succeeded, set `primary_linter: none` — that is the only path that produces it.

5. **`prose-style-checker` — always runs; its role depends on whether steps 1-3 succeeded.**
   - If steps 1-3 succeeded → run as **COMPLEMENTARY** pass. Merge findings with the primary pass.
   - If steps 1-3 errored → run as **FALLBACK** pass. Use as the sole result.
   - If steps 1-4 found no primary linter → run as **SOLE** pass.

   `prose-style` is a declared dependency of `docs-workflows`, so its `prose-style-checker` agent is always available — an unsatisfied dependency disables the plugin rather than letting a run reach this step without it. Invoke it:
   - `subagent_type: "prose-style:prose-style-checker"`
   - Input: `files: <the same files list>`, `doc_type: <"product-docs" for docs repos, "general" otherwise>`.

   Map the return into this agent's schema:
   - violations → recorded in `violations` with `source: complementary` (or `source: primary` when it was the SOLE / FALLBACK pass — see merge rules).
   - zero violations → no findings added.
   - `prose-style-checker` errored → record `complementary_error` (or `error` if it was the SOLE / FALLBACK pass).

   The complementary pass NEVER promotes the overall status to ERROR; it only adds findings or notes its own failure in `complementary_error`.

   - **When `prose-style-checker` took the SOLE or FALLBACK role** there was no complementary pass beside a primary one: record `complementary_linter: none` and map its violations with `source: primary`, per the merge rules.

## Merging primary + complementary findings (deduplication)

When both passes ran successfully, merge violations into a single `violations` list. Two findings from different passes are duplicates when **ALL THREE** match:

- same `file`
- same `line` (exact match, NOT a range)
- same conceptual issue (heuristic below)

**Conceptual-issue heuristic** (case-insensitive):

| Signal | Treated as same issue |
|---|---|
| Both messages mention `em-dash` / `em dash` / `—`, or a `Dashes` rule fired | yes |
| Both mention `contraction` or a `Contractions` rule fired | yes |
| Both reference `passive voice` | yes |
| Both flag the same `that is`→`that's`-style tightening | yes |
| Otherwise | no — keep both findings |

On dedupe, prefer the higher-severity finding; on a tie, prefer the primary pass (its rule IDs are shorter and more actionable). Vale and `prose-style-checker` use the same 1-indexed source-line basis, so line-level dedupe is safe. NEVER squash findings on adjacent lines, and NEVER dedupe across files.

## Violation schema

```yaml
file:       <absolute path>
line:       <line number>
rule:       <linter rule identifier, e.g. "Microsoft.Acronyms">
severity:   BLOCKER | MAJOR | MINOR | NIT
message:    <human-readable description>
suggestion: <linter's proposed fix, if any>
source:     primary | complementary   # which pass produced it (informational)
```

Severity mapping from linter output:

| Linter severity / level | Normalised severity |
|---|---|
| `error` | MAJOR |
| `warning` | MINOR |
| `suggestion` / `info` | NIT |
| (anything the linter marks as a blocking failure) | BLOCKER |

The plugin does NOT promote a linter MINOR into BLOCKER. The linter's own severity is authoritative.

## Output

```yaml
status:                OK | VIOLATIONS_FOUND | ERROR
primary_linter:        vale | per-space:<space id>[+<space id>…] | yarn:<script> | npm:<script> | markdownlint | remark | none
primary_command:       <exact command line executed for the primary pass, or null>
primary_attempts:      # every primary rung tried, in ladder order; [] only when step 1 succeeded first try
  - linter: vale | per-space:<space id> | pnpm:<script> | yarn:<script> | npm:<script> | markdownlint | remark
    outcome: succeeded | failed | not_detected
    reason:  <one line; null when outcome == succeeded>
complementary_linter:  prose-style-checker | none   # none = it ran as the SOLE / FALLBACK primary pass
complementary_command: <exact agent invocation for the complementary pass, or null>
violations:            [<merged + deduped array of the schema above; empty if status == OK>]
error:                 <only when status == ERROR: one-line reason; describes the PRIMARY pass failure>
complementary_error:   <only when the complementary pass failed independently; does NOT promote overall status to ERROR>
```

- `status: OK` — at least one pass ran and produced zero merged violations.
- `status: VIOLATIONS_FOUND` — at least one pass produced ≥ 1 violation (after merge + dedupe).
- `status: ERROR` — every primary rung failed or was never detected AND the `prose-style-checker` pass also failed. This is NOT a licence for the caller to continue unchecked: `/document` records the `style_check` gate as `UNAVAILABLE` and converts it per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/gate-ledger.md` §5 — in keyed mode before the reviewer, in direct mode before Phase 4.

## Hard rules

- NEVER modify files under `repo_root`. This agent reports; `doc-fixer` applies fixes.
- NEVER promote a MINOR / NIT style finding to BLOCKER. The linter's own severity is authoritative.
- NEVER run the whole-repo lint if a files-scoped invocation is available (performance + noise reduction). If Vale and markdownlint both accept per-file paths, pass only the input `files`.
- NEVER fabricate a `primary_command` or `complementary_command` value — if a pass didn't run, the field is `null`.
- NEVER return a `primary_attempts` list that omits a rung the ladder tried. It records each rung this run's ladder tried and how it ended — not what CI runs — so it is the caller's evidence for what this run did not check: the caller fills the gate ledger's `not_run` field from it, and its `ci_still_checks` field from it together with what the repository's CI actually runs, which may be nothing.
- A rung whose configuration is absent is still a rung the ladder passed: record it with `outcome: not_detected` and a one-line `reason` (e.g. "no Vale configuration file from the site up to the repo root"). `primary_attempts` describes the whole climb, not only the failures.
- NEVER stop the ladder at a *detected but failing* rung. Detection is not execution — only a rung that produced parseable output counts as the primary pass.
- NEVER output a partially filled violation record (missing `file` or `line`). Drop such records and note the count in `error` if suspicious.
- Cap each pass at 2 minutes (4 minutes total wall clock). On timeout, kill the pass and record it (`error` if primary, `complementary_error` if complementary).
- If a primary linter emits warnings about its own configuration (e.g. "Vale: no styles found") rather than content, treat it as a primary-pass failure and fall through to `prose-style-checker`; the complementary pass may still succeed.
- `prose-style` is a **declared dependency** of `docs-workflows`, so `prose-style-checker` is always available. NEVER branch on whether it is installed, and NEVER return a status meaning "no checker was available" — an unsatisfied dependency disables the plugin outright rather than producing a degraded run here.
- NEVER dispatch any subagent other than `prose-style:prose-style-checker`. That one dispatch is your entire `Task` authority. **Never dispatch a reviewer of your own.** Review is the caller's to schedule, not yours. Your caller deliberately runs no reviewer on some paths — `/document` direct mode is lightweight by design and has no `doc-reviewer` gate at all — so a reviewer you spawn silently overrides the caller's own gate policy. Its verdict has no standing either: the caller never sees it, and you cannot act on it without exceeding your brief.
