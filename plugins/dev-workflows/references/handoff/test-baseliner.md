## Input

```markdown
## Test Baseline Request
repo: /absolute/path/to/repo   # the project root, and the scan root in BOTH modes.
                               # Callers send it under their own label — `Project root:`
                               # throughout this plugin — and it is this field either way.
                               # Required for `mode: verify`; on `mode: capture` a caller
                               # may omit it and the scan falls back to the working
                               # directory, which no shipped caller relies on.
                               # The root sent on the capture call is sent again on every
                               # verify call against that baseline — and where a capture
                               # omitted it, the verify sends that same working directory —
                               # or the two runs have nothing to pair: `### Suites` records
                               # each marker as a path relative to THIS root, so the root is
                               # an operand of what verify PAIRS on — the half nothing
                               # downstream repairs, since verify step 5 rewrites a moved
                               # prefix onto the suite step 2 paired it with, and two roots
                               # move every marker path at once, which is more than step 2's
                               # one-of-each fallback can pair where a framework names more
                               # than one suite. So two roots report a tree that did not
                               # change as every suite moved, and — where a framework names
                               # more than one detected suite — every identifier of it as
                               # missing, with that rewrite and without it alike
                               # (agents/test-baseliner.md capture step 1, measured there).
mode: capture              # capture | verify
command_hint: "./mvnw test -q"   # optional; one or more commands. Detection still runs —
                                 # the hint narrows what is RUN, never what is DETECTED.
                                 # Omitted ⇒ every detected suite runs. A hint sent on the
                                 # capture call is sent again on every verify call against
                                 # that baseline — the same commands IN THE SAME ORDER —
                                 # or the two runs have nothing to pair: a command that
                                 # matches no detected suite is a suite whose `### Suites`
                                 # marker is `command_hint#<n>` for its position in the
                                 # hint, which is what tells two such suites apart and
                                 # what verify pairs them by.
                                 # A hinted command runs in the directory of the detected
                                 # suite it matches, or at the scan root (`repo:`, or the
                                 # working directory where a capture call omits it) where
                                 # it matches none — every other suite runs where capture
                                 # step 2's four sources put it, not at the scan root by
                                 # default, and that holds in BOTH modes
                                 # (agents/test-baseliner.md capture step 2, verify step 3).
baseline: |                # required for mode: verify — the full `## Test Baseline` block
  ## Test Baseline         # from the capture call, verbatim, `### Suites` included
  - **Mode**: capture
  …
```

**Hand verify the whole block, not a re-keyed digest of it.** Its `### Suites` rows are
what verify pairs the current run against; they are what separates a suite the
baseline recorded `OK` and that aborts now (a regression — the change is the only thing
that moved) from one that could not run at either end (`PARTIAL` — a fact about the
environment); and they are what verify step 5 reads the baseline's **own** identifier
prefixes off before it rewrites them onto this run's, since a framework's prefix there is
`[<Framework>] ` or `[<Framework> <that row's marker value>] ` according to how many rows
that framework has in this very section. A caller that passes counts alone leaves verify unable
to tell those apart, and a caller that passes the two test lists without `### Suites`
leaves it unable to rewrite them at all.

**No `model_routing:` block is passed.** The caller pins this agent's tier with `model:` on the dispatch, and nothing in the agent reads a field of that block.

## Output — capture mode

The agent returns a Markdown block, not YAML — this is the exact structure
(see `agents/test-baseliner.md` "Mode: capture" step 5):

```markdown
## Test Baseline
- **Mode**: capture
- **Status**: OK                 <!-- OK | PARTIAL | RUN_FAILED | COMMAND_NOT_FOUND | NO_TESTS -->
- **Framework**: Maven
- **Command**: `./mvnw test -q`
- **Total**: 47 | **Passing**: 47 | **Failing**: 0 | **Skipped**: 0

### Pre-existing failures
none

### Passing tests
[Maven] com.example.FooTest#testCreate
[Maven] com.example.BarTest#testLogin

### Notes
none

### Suites
Maven | pom.xml | `./mvnw test -q` | OK | Total 47, Passing 47, Failing 0, Skipped 0
```

**A repository with more than one suite baselines all of them**, which the block
above expresses without changing shape: **Framework** and **Command** become
comma-separated lists in run order — positionally paired, so a framework repeats
where the run holds more than one suite of it rather than being de-duplicated —
the counts are the sums and the two test lists are the union. **The identifier
prefix on those lists is not one of this paragraph's deltas: every identifier
carries it — in this block and in verify mode's own lists alike, a single-suite
repository's included** —
`[<Framework>] ` where that framework names exactly one row of `### Suites`, and
`[<Framework> <that row's marker value>] ` where it names more than one. That set
is what a hint cannot narrow rather than what ran — every detected suite has a row
whether the hint ran it or not, a candidate the workspaces division carved having
one per workspace rather than one of its own — so narrowing the run moves no prefix; and the marker
of a row a hint adds is a position in that hint and nothing else, which is why the same
commands are sent again in the same order (`agents/test-baseliner.md` capture steps 1
and 3). And
`### Suites` carries one line per suite the run has a row for — framework, the
qualifying marker **as a path relative to the scan root** (that workspace's own
`package.json` for each row of a workspaces division, never the candidate's;
`command_hint#<n>` where a hinted command matched no detected suite), command,
per-suite status, per-suite
counts — including any the `command_hint` left `not run`. Where more than one of that
row's markers qualified in the one directory, which of them the column records
is fixed by capture step 1 rather than by the scan's order, since two calls
recording different markers disagree on the key verify pairs on. The marker of a row a
marker qualified is a path rather than a bare filename, for two reasons. It tells apart two suites of one framework:
qualifying markers of one row whose directories do not contain each other are
siblings, and siblings are separate suites, so more than one row here can read
`Jest/npm` — as do the rows a workspaces division carves, each holding its own
workspace's `package.json` (`agents/test-baseliner.md` capture step 1). And for every suite whose
run directory is its marker's own, the path says where that row's command ran —
**the project root only where that marker sits at the scan root**, which is the
agent's own qualified form (*"The project root is that directory only for a suite
whose run directory resolves to it"*) and the rule holding in **both** modes
(`agents/test-baseliner.md` capture step 2 and verify step 3, each stating it at
its own number): `pom.xml` for a suite at the scan root,
`frontend/package.json` for one below it. **Three run directories are not a
marker's own** — a suite the `Make` wrapper folded runs at the `Makefile`'s, a
`--workspace` row of a workspaces division runs at the candidate's, and a hinted
command matching no suite runs at the scan root — and the first two are named in
`### Notes`, the third being what a `command_hint#<n>` marker value already says. A
single-suite repository's block is unchanged in every field, `### Suites` aside
— **the identifier prefix included**, which is why the example at the head of
this section carries `[Maven] ` on each of its two lists and why the prefix is
no longer one of the multi-suite deltas above. What retired that condition is
measured where the rule lives (`agents/test-baseliner.md` capture step 3), and
**a prefix that moves between a capture and its verify no longer makes a
regression of its own**: the condition that remains still reads each call's own
`### Suites` rows, so it moves whenever that set does, and verify step 5 rewrites
every baseline identifier's prefix onto its paired suite's current one before it
compares — three states, each measured there with that rewrite and without it. A
baseline row verify pairs with nothing is not rewritten, and its tests are
**Missing from run** exactly as they always were.

**`### Notes` is present on every capture return, "none" included**, and it
carries what no other field can: a suite whose watch carve-out did not fire and
why, a qualifying marker whose directory another of its own row's contains — a
workspace the division carved a row for being named in that row instead — the run directory
of a suite that did not run at its own marker's (a folded `Make` suite's
`Makefile`, the candidate's own for the `--workspace` rows of a workspaces
division), a `Make` wrapper one level did not
settle, "no runner found", a recipe whose output matched no parse pattern. Each
of those reads, from **Status** and
`### Suites` alone, exactly like a suite that genuinely failed — a `RUN_FAILED`
row with a command beside it — so a caller that reports a failed suite without
reading this section reports the wrong cause. Verify mode has carried the same
section since before capture did, and it is the same section: capture's detection
is what verify step 1 re-runs, so a note owed at one end is owed at both. What
verify adds to it is its own — this call's aborts, step 2's pairing facts, and
each prefix rewrite step 5 made — so a rewrite line there says a suite's prefix
moved between the two calls, never that anything about it failed.

**capture status values:**
- `OK` — every detected suite ran and produced counts, Total > 0
- `PARTIAL` — at least one suite produced counts and at least one did not. The
  baseline covers exactly the suites `### Suites` marks `OK` or `NO_TESTS`, and
  names each one it does not cover with the command that failed. It is
  incompleteness, never a verdict on the code: a caller that stops on it stops
  because a JavaScript runner is not installed
- `RUN_FAILED` — **every** suite that was run aborted with no parseable counts,
  so the baseline records nothing for a later verify to compare against
- `NO_TESTS` — every suite ran cleanly and the combined Total = 0
- `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` — no candidate matched and no `command_hint` supplied one,
  so nothing ran (**Framework** then reads `not detected`)

**Field mapping for callers that need YAML-shaped fields** (e.g. `vuln-fixer`'s
and `upgrade-executor`'s `baseline:` input — see their own handoff docs):
`passing_count` = the **Passing** number; `passing_tests` = the `### Passing
tests` list — with several suites, that number and that list are already the
totals across them, so neither caller changes. The orchestrator re-keys these
when constructing the next agent's prompt — this agent never emits raw YAML.
**Those two keys are a convenience beside the block, never a replacement for
it:** whatever else a caller sends, the `verify` call gets the whole block.

**verify status values (the authoritative field callers branch on):**
- `OK` — the comparison was possible and every previously-green test is still
  green. The aborts it tolerates are the ones that could lose no baseline
  *passing* test: a suite whose baseline row is `NO_TESTS`, one with no row at
  all because the suite is new since the baseline, and one whose baseline row is
  `OK` but which contributed no passing test — each of which `### Notes` names
- `REGRESSIONS` — one or more baseline tests now fail, or are missing from the
  run entirely; see the `### Regressions` / `### Missing from run` lists. A suite
  the baseline recorded `OK` with at least one passing test and that aborts here
  lands here too, because those tests are then unaccounted for — it ran before
  this change and does not now
- `PARTIAL` — no regressions, and at least one detected suite produced no counts
  here **and no counts in the baseline either — its baseline row reads
  `RUN_FAILED` or `not run`**, so it aborted at both ends or the `command_hint`
  left it out at both. The comparison is sound as far as it reaches and says
  nothing about that suite; `### Suites` names it. A suite whose baseline row is
  `NO_TESTS`, or which has no row at all, is **not** this — that abort is `OK`'s
  above, which is where the agent's own "set the first that applies" ladder
  (verify step 6) puts it
- `RUN_FAILED` — nothing was verified: no detected suite matches the baseline
  (**Comparison status**: `invalid`), or no suite produced counts in this run at
  all. It is tested **after** `REGRESSIONS`, so a run in which every suite aborted
  is a regression where the baseline had run them, and what reaches this value is
  a baseline holding no passing test that could go missing
- `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` — no candidate matched and no `command_hint` supplied one,
  so nothing ran (**Framework** then reads `not detected`) — the same test capture
  mode applies, a hint being something to run rather than nothing. Never emitted
  once a call reaches the run step

**What a consumer may do with each.** `REGRESSIONS` is the only value that is
evidence about the change, and the only one on which reverting it is warranted.
`PARTIAL`, `RUN_FAILED` and `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` each say a suite could not be
run — they are facts about the environment, so a consumer records which suite and
proceeds or escalates, and **never reverts work on them**. Reverting on one of
those rolls back a correct change in one language because a runner for another
is not installed.

**`### New failures` is outside that ladder, because it is not a `Status` value
at all.** A test failing now that was in neither baseline list moves no value
above, so `OK` and `PARTIAL` are both returned with that list non-empty. A caller
that writes tests between its capture and its verify — `/implement`, through
`test-writer` — reads the list as well as the `Status`, or it reads its own
broken test as a pass; `/upgrade` and `/vuln` write none and branch on the
`Status` alone.

**Note:** `passing_count` / `regressions` / `new_passes` as bare YAML keys
are a caller-side re-keying convenience, not literal fields this agent
emits — see the field mapping above and each consumer's own handoff doc
for the exact keys it expects back from the *orchestrator* (not from this
agent directly).
