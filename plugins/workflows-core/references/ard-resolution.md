# ARD resolution (embedded — shared reference)

Given a resolved item, resolve any applicable **Architecture Requirements/Decision Document(s)** produced by
`/create-ard` and return a normalized **ARD context** — or **`none`**. Cited by `/create-ard`, `/design`,
`/implement`, `/specify`, `/epics`, and `/ready` so the resolution logic, the **optional/no-regression** rule, and the deviation-record
convention live in ONE place.

## Inputs

`prd` (PRD key), `epic` (or `null`), `area` (or `null`), `$SPECS_PATH`.

## Resolution (most-specific first)

1. Resolve the PRD folder by calling `resolve-address <PRD>` — the entry point
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/addressing.md` §3 defines. It searches every level §3 bounds and
   carries §5's legacy fallback, so this step states no matching rule of its own: a key-number match
   tolerating a stray `-`/`_` and a human-adjusted slug is exactly what §5 does, and a second copy of
   it here is the drift `addressing.md` §1 warns about. `status: absent` → no ARD exists; return
   `none`.

   **This step is the only route by which that resolution reaches an ARD.** All six consumers below
   delegate their ARD lookup here, so five of them resolving their *own* PRD folder would still not
   find an ARD in a nested one — and `/implement` resolves no PRD folder at all, reaching an ARD
   solely by citing this file.
2. Collect candidate ARD files **inside the folder step 1 resolved**, by filename — never a path
   re-derived from the key (`addressing.md` §4):
   - **Epic-level** (`epic` set): the Epic folder's `ard.md` and any `ard-<area>.md` (the area-scoped
     file when `area` is given, else every per-area ARD) **plus** the PRD folder's own `ard.md` for
     inherited invariants.
   - **PRD-level** (`epic` null): only the PRD folder's `ard.md`.
3. Parse each file's `## Architecture decisions` into `AD#N {id, binds, prevents, rule, source}` where
   `source` ∈ `prd | epic | area`. PRD-level `AD#N` are the inherited base; Epic/area `AD#N` layer on top
   (Epic/area wins on any conflict — contradictions were already blocked by `ard-reviewer` at authoring).
   Accept **both** `### [AD#N]:` and the legacy `### [AD-N]:`, and ALWAYS emit the `#` form in `id`. <!-- id-grammar-ok: legacy reader tolerance -->
   This resolver is a **reader**, and an ARD has no `/update-ard` to convert it the way `/update-prd`
   converts a PRD, so a dash-form ARD authored by a pre-2.53.0 install on another machine would never
   drain. Failing to parse it is silent in the worst way: the file still resolves `status: found`, but
   with an empty `invariants` list every consumer's ARD-conformance dimension is skipped exactly as if
   no ARD existed — a binding architecture document enforcing nothing, under a run that reports success.

## Output — the ARD context, or `none`

```yaml
status: found | none | unmerged
ard_paths: [ <absolute paths of the ARD files used> ]
branch: <carrying branch> | null   # present only when status: unmerged
pr: <open pull request number> | null   # present only when status: unmerged
invariants:
  - id: AD#1
    source: prd | epic | area
    binds: <text>
    prevents: <text>
    rule: <testable statement>
guidance_summary: <short prose: the ARD's non-AD#N architecture guidance the consumer should heed>
```

`status: none` when no ARD file resolves (the common case — `/create-ard` is optional).

`status: unmerged` when an ARD file resolves but is **not on the specs repo's default branch** — verified via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/phase-handoff.md` §3 (`require-on-main`), which returns the carrying `branch` and any open `pr`. Both are passed through to the caller.

**`unmerged` is reachable only when an ARD file resolves.** An absent ARD is `none`, unchanged — see the no-regression rule below. This status does not make `/create-ard` a prerequisite for anything.

## No-regression rule (central)

A caller that gets `status: none` **MUST behave exactly as it did before this feature** — no prompt, no
extra phase output, no reviewer dimension. The ARD steps are strictly additive and guarded on
`status: found`.

A caller that gets `status: unmerged` **stops**, naming the branch and any open pull request, except `/ready` — which is a read-only verifier and records it as a readiness finding capping the verdict at `PARTIAL`. The distinction matters: reporting a phase as complete while its ARD sits unmerged is exactly the claim `/ready` exists to check.

## Deviation-record convention

When an artifact must NOT honor an `AD#N`, the consumer records — in its **own** artifact, NEVER in the
ARD (role separation: the ARD is the architect's) — a line:

`- ARD deviation: [<AD#N id>] — <what deviates> — <why> — flag: architect`

and surfaces it in the run's final report. A reviewer treats a violating artifact **with** a matching
deviation record as *allowed-but-flagged* (the architect adjudicates), **without** one as a **BLOCKER**.

## Consumers (informative)

- `/create-ard` — reads the inherited PRD-level ARD on an Epic-level run (`epic: null` maps to PRD-level-only); `AD#N` = the invariants the newly-authored Epic-level `AD#N` must not contradict; `ard-reviewer` checks non-contradiction directly against the drafted file — no separate deviation-record path.
- `/design` — Epic-level ARD = design guidance; PRD-level `AD#N` = inherited invariants; deviations → a `## ARD deviations` section in `design.md` + an open question.
- `/implement` — keyed runs only; `AD#N` = implementation guardrails; deviations → the Phase 5 report. Direct mode → `none`.
- `/specify` — keep user stories + scope consistent with `AD#N` + scope; deviations → the spec's `### Open questions`.
- `/epics` — PRD-level only (`epic: null`, Epics do not exist yet); `AD#N` = inherited invariants the drafted Epics must respect; deviations → a `- ARD deviation: …` line in the Epic draft + the Phase 9 report.
- `/ready` — PRD-level + Epic-level `AD#N` = inherited invariants passed to `readiness-reviewer` as `applicable_ard`; read-only — it never authors a deviation record, only checks the artifacts it reads for an existing one.

The other five pass `invariants` to their reviewer as `applicable_ard`; the reviewer's ARD-conformance dimension is skipped entirely when it is absent. `/create-ard` alone does not: it inherits PRD-level `AD#N` read-only straight into its own grill and drafting (Phase 4), and `ard-reviewer` checks non-contradiction directly against the drafted file, never via that field.
