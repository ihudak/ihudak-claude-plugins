name: brd-interview
description: BRD decision workflow (PM phase, the BRD-to-PRD route's decision step, run once per slice once `/prd-ground` and `/brd-split` have both run on it). Gates on the BRD's grounding being merged, every finding carrying a verifier outcome, and its coverage ledger fully allocated, then generates the round's question set and tags every question [G]/[V]/[C] before a single one is asked. Answers every [G] from the grounding findings and never puts one to a human; puts each [V] to the operator one at a time via AskUserQuestion with mandatory argumentation; holds every [C] for the customer. Re-tags a [G] only against a named NOT-PROVABLE finding, splits any question carrying more than one tag, and refuses to close a decision resting solely on a will-change finding. Writes decisions.md ([VD#n] and [AS#n]), the round record, and the [C] question set, plus the code-defect log where a decision turns on one. --round N resumes an open round or re-opens a closed one, recorded with its cause. Takes no --no-docs and does no documentation grounding.

Turn the grounded BRD into a decided one, one round at a time: $ARGUMENTS

**Core references.** A citation of the form `workflows-core:<name>` names a shared reference in the `workflows-core` plugin. Load it with `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "<name>")` — never by path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to this plugin, which does not carry it.

`/brd-interview` is the **BRD-to-PRD route's decision step** (PM phase) — it takes the verified
findings `/prd-ground` produced and the fully-allocated ledger `/brd-split` left behind, and works
the BRD's open questions to recorded decisions. Its whole discipline is one rule: **every question
is tagged before it is asked, and the tag decides who may answer it**
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/interview-tagging.md` §1). This command exists to make that
happen, not to restate it.

Usage: `/brd-interview <BRD-KEY> [--round N]`

`<BRD-KEY>` still resolves through `resolve-address`, which searches every level
`workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds — three below `specifications/` — and so returns a BRD that owns
its source document, one of its slices, an idea-route PRD folder or an Epic folder alike, because a
root must be resolved before Phase 0 step 5a can refuse it by name. **Only a slice is
interviewed: a root BRD is refused, and deciding happens at the slice and nowhere else** — a slice
holds its own findings, its own ledger, and its own register, and it reaches its decisions exactly
as its parent does. The register this run writes is the register of the BRD it was given, and no
other.

**Standing rule, binding on every phase below.** A `[G]` is answered from the grounding findings and
is **never put to a human** — not the customer, not the delivery team, not the operator watching the
run (`interview-tagging.md` §1, D8). A `[V]` is put to the operator with recorded argumentation and
is **never routed to the customer** as a business question (§1, D9). A `[C]` is held. The section
*How no `[G]` reaches a human* below states the ordering that makes the first of those structural
rather than aspirational.

**This command takes no `--no-docs`, and it does no documentation grounding at all. That is a
decision, not an omission.** `/brd-intake` and `/prd-ground` already ground this BRD against the
shipped product documentation when `$DOCS_PATH` resolves (D22,
`workflows-core:docs-grounding`), and their run is the one that had the
requirement text and the code in front of it. This command operates on **decisions** — on findings
that have already been verified and on choices the delivery team and the customer own — and a
documentation page settles none of those: it is a claim *about* behaviour, not the behaviour, which
is why `/prd-ground` already forbids one as evidence for a `[CG#n]`. So there is no flag to turn
off, no `resolve-docs-grounding` call, and no `docs grounding:` line in this command's report. The
sentence is written here because leaving it unwritten is exactly how the gap it forecloses gets
shipped.

**No repository is opened, at any point.** Every `file:line` this command reads has already been
pinned and verified by `/prd-ground`, so there is no baseline gate here, no dirty-tree stop, and no
`$REPOS_PATH` requirement. A question that would need a repository opened to answer it is a question
this command cannot settle, and the *Answer every `[G]` from the findings* phase says what happens
to it — which is never "ask somebody instead".

**Nothing is written into the BRD folder before *Write the register and the round record*.** Every
phase before it that records something — a tag, an answer, a split, a re-tag, a holding state, a
disposition, the round's scope, a `[C]` entry, a defect line, a re-open — records it in what this
run **holds** for that phase, never on disk: the round record is the commit point
(`decision-register-format.md` §8), so a round record created early would make a run that stops
before that phase leave a record naming what it never finished. Read every "record" and "write"
below this line, until that phase, in that sense. **Two writes are exceptions, and neither records
anything new**: *Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD* completes a re-disposition a counted
round record already names (step 9); and *Resolve the round*'s no-new-round path, a completed run
that never reaches that phase, writes the register's header where none is on file and removes and
reports torn writes before its handoff.

## How no `[G]` reaches a human

Five properties, and every one of them is a property of the **order and the inputs of the phases
below**, not an instruction to be careful. Together they are the guarantee; individually none of
them is.

1. **Tagging precedes asking, for the whole set at once.** The *Tag every question* phase runs to
   completion over the entire round before the *Put each `[V]` to the operator* phase opens. A
   question with no tag, or with more than one, does not reach an asking phase at all — it is split
   or rewritten where it stands.
2. **The phase that answers `[G]` questions raises no prompt of any kind.** It reads findings and
   holds answers for the round record. It has no `AskUserQuestion` call, no free-text prompt, and no "just to confirm"
   path, and it runs to completion before any operator prompt is opened.
3. **The operator queue is whatever the tagging phase has fixed, and nothing else ever reaches it.**
   The *Put each `[V]` to the operator* phase takes the `[V]` set that phase produced — including
   anything the `[G]` phase re-tagged into `[V]`, which re-enters at tagging and is re-tested there
   before it joins the set (property 4). What the queue is never appended to is a question that
   **has not been through the tagging phase**: no phase adds to it directly, and once this phase
   opens, nothing is added to it at all. Stating it as "the `[V]` list alone, never appended to from
   another tag" would be false — a re-tagged `[G]` is a question from another tag, and it is
   supposed to arrive — and a guarantee that is false in its own ordinary case is one nobody can
   check the interesting case against. **And a `[V]` the set holds with a terminal disposition
   already on it never reaches the queue**: the standing re-decision *A later round is generated
   from what changed* records, in the round being generated or in a round resumed, arrives
   answered, and the queue asks only what is not.
4. **A `[G]` leaves the `[G]` set only by re-tagging, and re-tagging re-enters at the tagging
   phase.** It never enters the operator queue directly. And a re-tag is admissible only against a
   named `NOT-PROVABLE` finding or an `unprovable` verifier outcome (`interview-tagging.md` §3):
   **a re-tag with no finding to name is not a re-tag**, so "the code did not tell us, so let us ask
   someone" has no route through this command.
5. **Every prompt this command raises is enumerated, and only one of them carries a question from
   the question set.** They are: the `SPECS_PATH` escalation in *Resolve inputs and gate the grounded
   BRD*; the round re-open cause prompt in *Resolve the round*; the `[V]` queue and the argumentation
   prompt that follows each of its answers; the code-defect offer that follows it; the will-change
   resolution picker; the handoff choice; the next-step offer; and, in *Put each `[V]` to the
   operator*, the re-put tie picker for a resumed `[V]` whose `[V]` tag is on file with no
   `- **Re-puts:**` line. Only
   the third carries a question from the set — and the argumentation prompt inside it asks why the
   answer just given was given, never a question of its own. The tie picker names a question of the
   set but asks only which record it puts again, never for its answer.

   **Two further prompts can appear, raised inside shared entry points this command executes rather
   than by the command itself, and neither can carry a question from the set** — because neither
   entry point is ever handed one: `require-on-main`'s row-C repair offer (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.3),
   which asks whether to switch the specs repo to its default branch, and `emit-cost`'s pending-file
   relocation confirmation (`workflows-core:cost-emission` §9), which asks where a cost entry should land. They
   are named so that "every prompt is enumerated" stays a checkable claim rather than one that
   quietly excludes whatever a cited entry point does.

The failure all five exist to prevent is stated once, in `interview-tagging.md` §2, and is not
restated here: a `[G]` put to a person returns their belief about the system rather than the system,
and nothing downstream can tell the difference afterwards.

## Phase 0 — Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD

1. **`<BRD-KEY>` (mandatory).** Parse the first token that is neither a flag nor a flag's value — `--round` consumes the token after it (step 2), and a value skipped as "non-flag" would be read as the key; validate with `key-valid`
   (`workflows-core:addressing` §1). If absent or invalid, stop:
   `BRD_INTERVIEW_NEEDS_KEY: /brd-interview needs a BRD key (shape ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*(-\d+)+$) — re-run '/product-workflows:brd-interview <KEY>'.`
2. **`--round N`.** Optional, consuming the next token, which must be a positive integer. Malformed
   or absent value → stop, rather than silently falling back to the no-flag behaviour, which would
   run a different round from the one that was asked for:
   `BRD_INTERVIEW_BAD_ROUND: --round takes a positive integer round number — re-run '/product-workflows:brd-interview <KEY> --round <N>', or omit the flag to continue at the first round still holding a question without a terminal disposition.`
   What the flag then does is the *Resolve the round* phase's business.
3. **`$SPECS_PATH` (required).** If unset, stop naming `SPECS_PATH`, per the
   `Required path environment variable unset` rule in
   `workflows-core:escalation-rules`:
   ```
   choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]
   ```
4. **Specs-repo preflight.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git specs-preflight")` and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline, **before** the gate below — `require-on-main`
   performs no fetch of its own (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.2) and relies on this step's best-effort one,
   the same ordering `/prd-ground` uses and for the same reason. Prompt-free and silent when the
   specs repo is clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5 notice; if it returns
   `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag for the whole run.
5. **Resolve the BRD folder.** `resolve-address <BRD-KEY>` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3), which searches
   every level `workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds — three below `specifications/`, plus §5's legacy fallback — and so can return any folder kind it finds there: a `BRD-` folder directly under `specifications/`, a `PRD-` folder (a slice inside a BRD, or an idea-route PRD folder), or an `EPIC-` folder inside a `PRD-` folder. Step 5a answers the level question on what it returns. Absent
   → stop, without asserting which command would have created it, because nothing on disk says
   whether this key names a BRD with a source document or a slice of one:
   `BRD_INTERVIEW_NOT_FOUND: no folder found for <BRD-KEY> under $SPECS_PATH/specifications/ (every level addressing.md §3 bounds, plus §5's legacy fallback) — check the key. A BRD with a source document of its own is created by /product-workflows:brd-intake <BRD-KEY> @<brd-file>; a slice is created by /product-workflows:brd-split on its parent.`
5a. **The root and Epic refusals — deciding happens at the slice and nowhere else.** Take this the moment
    step 5 returns a resolved folder, before step 6 opens anything — the level question is answered
    before any gate that follows it. Test the **resolved directory's prefix**: `BRD-` is a root,
    `EPIC-` an Epic folder, `PRD-` a slice or an idea-route PRD folder, which step 5b tells apart — the kind-prefix convention `workflows-core:addressing` §2 fixes, read off
    the resolved folder's own name. **Never test the folder's asserted `kind:`** — `/brd-split`
    writes `kind: brd` into the `brd-link.md` it places inside the `PRD-` slice folder it carves
    (`commands/brd-split.md` Phase 3), so a slice **asserts** `brd` while being exactly the folder
    this refusal must accept; a gate on the asserted kind would refuse every slice and accept
    nothing.

    **Where the folder resolved through `workflows-core:addressing` §5's legacy unprefixed fallback,
    there is no prefix to test.** Answer the root question by **positive evidence, never by the
    absence of a file** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1, the
    shared authority every consumer of this test in this plugin takes it from, directly or through
    `workflows-core:addressing` §4.1, and not restated here — and the Epic question the same way, as
    §4.1 places a folder with no prefix: a resolved `kind: epic` is an Epic folder, refused below
    exactly as an `EPIC-` folder is.

    **An `EPIC-` folder is refused on the same prefix test, and at the same moment.**
    `resolve-address` searches every level `workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds, the Epic level
    included, so an Epic's key resolves here exactly as a slice's does — and without this refusal an
    `EPIC-` folder, which is neither `BRD-` nor `PRD-`, passed both this step and step 5b and reached
    step 6 on a folder that holds no coverage ledger, inventory or grounding of its own, whose row-F branch then named a remedy for a BRD it
    is not. A prefix is the name beginning `EPIC-<the resolved key>-`, as §4.1 defines one, so a
    legacy folder whose key merely begins `EPIC-` is not refused by its name.

    On a root, look for the root-level artifacts this run would have produced under the retired
    two-level model — `decisions.md`, `interview/` — and name whichever exist in the stop, so an
    operator whose BRD was interviewed under that model is told the level moved rather than that
    their key is wrong. Never delete them; they record work done, and nothing in this run reads
    them.

    Stop:
    `BRD_INTERVIEW_ROOT_LEVEL: <BRD-KEY> is a root BRD, and deciding happens at the slice. Carve one with '/product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY> "<how to cut it>"', then run '/product-workflows:brd-interview <SLICE-KEY>'.<where root-level artifacts exist, append:> This BRD carries root-level decisions and interview records at <paths> from the earlier two-level model; it is left in place, and this command never reads it.`

    Stop, on an Epic folder:
    `BRD_INTERVIEW_EPIC_LEVEL: <KEY> resolves to an Epic folder at <path>, and deciding happens at a slice carved from a customer's BRD — an Epic is refined from the PRD folder above it and holds no coverage ledger, inventory or grounding of its own. No gate was run and nothing was written. <remedy> Re-running this command on this Epic stops here again.`
    `<remedy>` turns on the folder containing this one: where it carries a `brd-link.md` naming a
    `parent:` — a slice — `Run '/product-workflows:brd-interview <SLICE-KEY>' against the slice this Epic sits in.`, `<SLICE-KEY>` being that `brd-link.md`'s own `key`, read and
    never parsed out of either folder's name; anywhere else, `The folder above it is not a slice carved from a customer's BRD, so there is nothing for this command to decide here.` — naming no command, since step 5b refuses an idea-route PRD folder too. It is an argument halt, so `emit-block` does not fire.
5b. **The idea-route refusal — a `PRD-` folder is a slice only where a BRD carved it.** Step 5a's
    prefix test accepts every `PRD-` folder, and an idea-route PRD folder — `/product-workflows:create-prd`'s
    own output, never carved from a BRD — is one. Take this immediately after 5a, before step 6
    opens anything: nothing below may read an inventory or a ledger on a folder that has neither.
    Decide it by **positive evidence, exactly as `/product-workflows:prd-ground` Phase 0 step 5a
    sets `route: idea`**, and never by the absence of a ledger or inventory alone:
    - **A `PRD-` directory carrying no `brd-link.md`** — `/brd-split` is the only writer of a
      `brd-link.md` naming a `parent:` inside a `PRD-` folder, so this one was never carved from a
      BRD.
    - **A folder resolved through `workflows-core:addressing` §5's legacy unprefixed fallback,
      carrying no `brd-link.md`, neither `coverage-ledger.md` nor `brd/brd-inventory.md`, and a
      `prd.md` asserting `kind: prd`** — a legacy idea-route PRD folder
      (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1). The same shape without
      such a `prd.md` is not decided here — a legacy folder holding only an `idea.md`, say — and
      step 6's row-F branch still has to ask.

    Stop:
    `BRD_INTERVIEW_NOT_A_SLICE: <KEY> resolves to an idea-route PRD folder (<path> carries no brd-link.md), not a slice carved from a customer's BRD — no gate was run and nothing was written. Interviewing settles a BRD slice's requirements into a decision register the customer reviews, and this folder has no coverage ledger, no requirement inventory and no customer BRD to decide against. The idea route goes on from its PRD: run '/product-workflows:create-ard <KEY>' or '/product-workflows:specify <KEY>' (after '/product-workflows:create-prd <KEY>', its handoff merged, where the folder holds no prd.md yet — each gates prd.md with require-on-main); each reads this folder's grounding/ findings wherever /product-workflows:prd-ground wrote them, and marks the ones it drew on. Re-running this command on this folder stops here again, whatever grounding it holds.`
6. **Gate the grounding deliverable on main.** This command **consumes** a `$SPECS_PATH` deliverable
   it did not write, so per `workflows-core:phase-handoff` §5 rule 2 it executes
   `require-on-main` (§3) here, before anything else reads a file. Execute it against the resolved
   folder's `grounding/code-grounding.md` — the same file `/brd-split` gates, and for the same reason:
   every deliverable one `handoff-to-main` run stages lands in a single commit (§2.3), so its presence
   on `origin/<default>` implies `grounding/design-grounding.md` and `brd-link.md` merged with it — **That implication holds for a full `/prd-ground` run and not for a `--no-code` one**, whose `deliverable_paths` is `grounding/design-grounding.md` alone and lands in its own later commit — so a BRD can legitimately have `code-grounding.md` merged and `design-grounding.md` on no ref at all. Anything reading the design findings gates them separately rather than inheriting this sentence. And
   `/prd-ground`'s own gate on `coverage-ledger.md` had already run before those findings existed at
   all. Map the §3.7 return by `stopped` first: any stopping row → stop, naming the concrete branch/PR
   state it reports; `pass` → proceed; `pass_amending` → proceed, printing the §3.3 row-B message;
   `unmanaged` → proceed as before this feature; `absent` (row F — grounding findings are on no ref at
   all) → **split it before stopping, on a test row F cannot make**, the way `/brd-reconcile` splits
   its own row F. Row F covers more than one state here, and the message for any state in which
   `/prd-ground` would not produce the findings this gate wants must not name it. Read
   `<BRD-dir>/brd/brd-inventory.md` from the worktree and count its `[BR#n]` rows:
   - **One or more rows** — grounding simply has not run yet, and running it is the fix:
     `BRD_INTERVIEW_NEEDS_GROUNDING: no grounding findings on file for <BRD-KEY> — run /product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> first.`
   - **Zero rows, or no inventory file at all** — `/prd-ground` would not produce the findings this
     gate wants, and naming it here would be the loop. The fix is upstream, so read the resolved
     folder's `brd-link.md` and branch on its `parent:` field — and, on a slice, on whether the
     inventory file is there at all, because an absent inventory and an empty one are different
     states with different fixes, exactly as `/product-workflows:prd-ground` Phase 0 step 6 splits
     them (`PRD_GROUND_NO_INVENTORY` against step 8's `PRD_GROUND_EMPTY_INVENTORY`). This read is a
     bare worktree read with no gate ahead of it. 5a's own legacy-fallback test lets a folder
     carrying **neither** `coverage-ledger.md` **nor** `brd/brd-inventory.md` through unrefused
     (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1), and step 5b refuses such a folder only where it holds a
     `prd.md` asserting `kind: prd`, so a folder reaching this branch is not always the slice step 5a
     would otherwise guarantee — a legacy unprefixed folder holding only an `idea.md`, say, gets this
     far. Nor does an interrupted intake change the remedy: since 3.7.0 `/brd-intake` writes the
     inventory's header before it copies anything (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md`
     §2), and a folder an earlier intake left with `brd/source/` alone carries neither BRD file, so
     `/brd-intake` refuses it too and the remedy is the same as the first branch below gives. The
     branches:
     - **No `brd-link.md`, or one with no `parent:`** — not a slice, and not a root: a folder
       holding an inventory beside no `brd-link.md` naming a `parent:` has already been refused, a
       legacy one by 5a's §5.1 test and a `PRD-` one carrying no `brd-link.md` at all by 5b. What
       reaches here is an unprefixed folder carrying neither BRD file, or a `PRD-` folder whose
       `brd-link.md` names no `parent:`, which no command writes (`/brd-split` is the only writer of
       one inside a `PRD-` folder, and always with `parent:`). **Name no re-run of `/brd-intake`
       over it**: that command re-runs only over a container (`workflows-core:addressing` §4.1)
       and refuses this folder with `BRD_INTAKE_NOT_A_BRD`, so a customer's BRD is intaken under a
       new key instead. Substitute `<what it carries>` with the folder's top-level files and
       subdirectories, as read:
       `BRD_INTERVIEW_EMPTY_INVENTORY: <BRD-KEY> resolves to <path>, which carries <what it carries> and no brd-link.md naming a parent: — it is not a slice carved from a customer's BRD, and not a BRD /product-workflows:brd-intake would re-run over, since that command refuses any folder that is not a BRD container. There is nothing to ground and no question this command could ask; nothing was written. Do not run /product-workflows:prd-ground, which refuses this folder before it reads any inventory. To intake a customer's BRD, run '/product-workflows:brd-intake <NEW-KEY> @<brd-file>' with a key no folder under $SPECS_PATH/specifications/ asserts; this folder is left exactly as it stands.<where the folder holds an idea.md and no prd.md, append:> It holds an idea.md and no prd.md, so the idea route goes on from it: run '/product-workflows:create-prd <BRD-KEY>', merge its handoff, then '/product-workflows:create-ard <BRD-KEY>' or '/product-workflows:specify <BRD-KEY>' — each gates prd.md with require-on-main.`
       The appended sentence is the legacy unprefixed folder holding only an `idea.md` — an idea
       handed off before the kind prefixes, which step 5b leaves undecided — and `/create-prd`
       accepts it (`workflows-core:addressing` §4.1, §5), so the fresh intake is not its only
       exit.
     - **`parent: <PARENT-KEY>` present, and no `brd/brd-inventory.md` in the folder** — a slice
       with no inventory file at all, which is not the same as one whose inventory holds no row
       (below). Two causes reach it, and the remedy table cited below tells them apart by this slice's
       `claims:` and the parent's ledger: the inventory was
       **never written** — a `/brd-split` run on the parent interrupted after it wrote this slice's
       `brd-link.md` — or it was **written and has since been lost** from the working tree. Stop:
       `BRD_INTERVIEW_NO_INVENTORY: <BRD-KEY> is a slice of <PARENT-KEY> and has no brd/brd-inventory.md, so there is no claim list to ground or to decide. <remedy>`
       — `<remedy>` taken from the table `/product-workflows:prd-ground` Phase 0 step 6 gives its own
       `PRD_GROUND_NO_INVENTORY` on a slice, read the same way and never restated here — that
       table is the one place the remedy for each cause above is fixed, so a change to it reaches
       this stop without a second copy to drift.
     - **`parent: <PARENT-KEY>` present, and the inventory present with no row** — this is a slice
       that claims nothing.
       Where `<PARENT-KEY>`'s own `coverage-ledger.md` cannot be read, the stop names neither `/brd-split` form: replace its text from `Re-run /product-workflows:brd-split on <PARENT-KEY>` to the end exactly as `/product-workflows:prd-ground` Phase 0 step 8 replaces its own copy's, since which form runs is that ledger's to say.
       Otherwise:
       `BRD_INTERVIEW_EMPTY_INVENTORY: <BRD-KEY> is a slice of <PARENT-KEY> and its inventory holds no [BR#n] row — it claims nothing, so there is nothing to ground and nothing to decide. Do not run /product-workflows:prd-ground, and do not run /product-workflows:brd-intake on a slice; it has no source document of its own. Re-run /product-workflows:brd-split on <PARENT-KEY>: either way it resolves every standing empty child, so it will offer to remove this slice or to keep it against its recorded reason. Which form to type depends on that parent's own ledger. Where it still holds an unallocated row, the run walks it too and will offer covered-by against this slice — and a run with rows still to place needs a slicing instruction to group them, so type '/product-workflows:brd-split <PARENT-KEY> "<how to cut it>"'. Where no row is left unallocated, the bare '/product-workflows:brd-split <PARENT-KEY>' is the run, and removing this slice or keeping it against a recorded reason is the whole of what it offers here. Adding an instruction to that same run, '/product-workflows:brd-split <PARENT-KEY> "<what to peel off>"', can additionally re-cut onto this slice a row the parent delegated to a sibling that has since recorded it will not build it — the one case, apart from the key repair a removal performs, in which /brd-split re-allocates a row already carrying a fate, and the only third thing that can change this slice's state. That third one is not guaranteed to be on offer: it needs such a row to exist, and it needs this slice never to have been interviewed, so a slice emptied after its own interview can only be removed or kept.`
7. **Gate on verification — and on there being grounding to verify.** Three tests, in this order,
   because **the second is a count and a count is vacuously satisfied by an empty set**. This gate
   shipped as the count alone, exactly as `/brd-split`'s did: zero findings on file means zero
   findings missing an outcome, so a BRD with no grounding at all passed it. **It matters more here
   than there**, by this step's own reasoning below: with zero findings the run answers every `[G]`
   from an empty evidence set and freezes `[VD#n]` against nothing, which is strictly worse than the
   unverified case the count does catch. And the state is reachable without anyone being careless —
   a slice whose ledger rows the parent's `/brd-split` set to `covered-here` passes step 8 without
   `/brd-split` ever having run **on the slice**, so the slice never meets that command's own
   presence relations.

   a. **There is code grounding.** Read `<BRD-dir>/grounding/code-grounding.md` from the worktree —
      step 6 already proved it is on `origin/<default>` — and count its `[CG#n]` blocks, parsed per
      `workflows-core:grounding-format` §2.1. Zero → stop. Step 6's row-F branch catches the file
      being on no ref; nothing until now caught it being on main and holding nothing:
      `BRD_INTERVIEW_NO_FINDINGS: <BRD-KEY>'s grounding/code-grounding.md is on main but records no [CG#n] finding — re-run '/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY>' and merge its handoff before interviewing. Every [G] is answered from the findings and from nothing else.`
   b. **Every finding carries a verifier outcome.** Read every `[CG#n]` and `[DG#n]` on file and
      count those carrying no recorded verifier `outcome` (one of the four in
      `workflows-core:grounding-format` §8). Any count `N` greater than zero →
      stop: `BRD_INTERVIEW_UNVERIFIED: N findings have no verifier verdict — run /product-workflows:prd-ground first.`
   c. **No finding block carries a field the record's format does not define.** Parse every
      `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` block per `workflows-core:grounding-format` §2.1 and test each key against
      that section's **closed** field set — §2's fields, plus `outcome` and `notes`. Any other key
      fails. The test is derived from that section, never from a list here, which is what admits a
      field §2 gains — `control` (§2.2) is one — without this gate being touched. **The keys that
      actually occur are the verifier's own return fields**, and `own_verdict` above all: transcribed
      into the record it leaves the block stating two verdicts at once. `control_outcome` is the same
      mistake with a different consequence — it is one verifier's judgement about whether that
      finding's control fired, so a block carrying it asserts as a property of the finding something
      only a re-derivation establishes. **Test b. cannot see** either: the block carries an `outcome`, so it passes on presence. This gate matters more here
      than anywhere else on the route — every `[G]` question is answered from the findings and from
      nothing else, so a finding with two verdicts is a `[VD#n]` frozen against whichever half the
      run happened to read, and `/brd-package` puts that decision in front of the customer.
      stop: `BRD_INTERVIEW_MALFORMED_FINDING: N finding blocks carry a key workflows-core:grounding-format §2.1 does not define (<finding-id>: <key>, …) — the record's field set is closed to §2's fields plus outcome and notes. A block carrying own_verdict beside verdict states two verdicts at once, and every [G] answered from it is answered from whichever half was read. Remove the offending key from each block by hand in <path>, leaving every other key untouched, and re-run. Do not re-run '/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> --rebaseline' for this: it re-grounds every claim against current commits to delete a line no command should have written.`

   **No design-presence relation here, and that is deliberate rather than an omission.**
   `/brd-split`'s third test exists because allocating a requirement to a slice that will be built
   commits to a design nobody reconciled. This command answers questions from findings; a frame set
   with no `[DG#n]` yields no `[G]` to answer wrongly, and `/brd-split` gates the same BRD before any
   slice reaches build. Adding it here would refuse an interview that is not the thing at risk.

   This gate is not borrowed ceremony. A finding without an outcome "is not evidence"
   (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §8), and a decision's `evidence` list is a list of findings
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-register-format.md` §1) — so a `[G]` answered from an
   unverified finding, or a `[VD#n]` resting on one, would put an unchecked claim behind a recorded
   decision, which is worse than an open question.
8. **Gate on allocation.** Read `<BRD-dir>/coverage-ledger.md` and count the rows whose
   `disposition` is `unallocated` **as written on this ledger**. Any such row → stop:
   `BRD_INTERVIEW_UNALLOCATED: N coverage-ledger rows are still unallocated for <BRD-KEY> — run /product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY> first.`
   Interviewing a BRD whose requirements have no recorded fate would take positions on requirements
   nobody has yet decided this BRD is building.

   **Read the dispositions in the file; never the ledger line.** The line's `unallocated` term is a
   *resolved* count that follows every `covered-by` row one hop into the BRD it names, so a
   fully-allocated parent routinely reports a non-zero term for rows a child has not walked yet
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §6.1, which states outright that a
   consumer testing the gate reads the dispositions and never the line). Gating on the line would
   refuse to interview a BRD that is completely allocated, for work that belongs to a different BRD's
   walk.
9. **Read the inputs the rest of the run works from**, from the gated folder: every verified
   `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` with its `verdict`, `evidence`, `control` where it carries one, `horizon` and
   verifier `outcome` (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §2, §2.2, §3, §5); `brd/brd-inventory.md`'s `[BR#n]` rows; `coverage-ledger.md`;
   `brd-link.md` (its `parent:` and any `depends-on:`); and, when they already exist, `decisions.md`,
   every `interview/round-<N>.md`, and `code-defect-log.md`. **Three more come from the parent's
   folder, one hop** (`brd-format.md` §2.1, §4), because the requirement-defect question source
   (*Round 1 is generated from the grounding*) reads them: `brd/brd-defect-log.md`,
   `brd/brd-inventory.md` and `coverage-ledger.md` — and, from there, the `coverage-ledger.md` of each
   slice under the parent, **this one included**, that ledger records `covered-by` against a row an
   open requirement defect joins — the row its entry is raised on, or one its entry names — which is
   how that source tells a live row from a settled one. **Read as *sibling* slices it is the wrong
   set**, and on a parent carrying one slice it is the empty one: the source's own tests
   (*Round 1 is generated from the grounding*) say *any slice under the same parent, this one
   included*, and a run that dropped its own ledger from the input would answer every one of them
   against a hole. Also the
   `interview/customer-questions.md` of every slice under the parent (the positive `brd-link.md`
   parent test, `commands/brd-split.md` Phase 0), which is how it tells a defect already asked from
   one that is not — an absent one holds no entry — **with every `interview/round-<N>.md` beside
   it**, since an entry no round record names is a torn write and asks nothing. **Every read above is
   through `decision-register-format.md` §8: no torn write counts**, in this BRD's folder or a
   sibling's, and a round record that exists and cannot be read leaves the items it would name
   undecidable, as an unreadable question set does (*Round 1 is generated from the grounding*).
   **Report each torn write in this BRD's folder now**, before anything is written — each record by
   id, each `[CDF#n]` by id, each entry by its heading and each defect line by its `[DEF#n]` and
   entry, with the round it claims and whether that round has no record or a record that does not
   name it — and say that this run removes them if it reaches its handoff. They are
   what a run that stopped before its round record was written left behind, whether an earlier
   version wrote them before its own register phase or this one was interrupted inside it; a record
   carrying a `Reopened` paragraph, which §8 never counts torn, is reported beside them where its
   `round` names a round whose record does not name it, as a re-decision that stands. **Report, too,
   every `## Round <N>, question <position>` heading that more than one entry of this BRD's
   `interview/customer-questions.md` carries**, with the round, the position and how many carry it:
   an earlier version wrote an entry for each `[C]` of the round on every run, resumes included, and
   §8 counts every such entry that its round record names, so nothing here removes one. Say that
   `/product-workflows:brd-package` would put the question to the customer once per entry, and that
   the operator reduces them to one by hand, keeping every labelled line any of them carries. A
   previous run's register, round records and
   code-defect log are inputs, never scratch: nothing below deletes, renumbers or rewrites a record
   another run wrote, **save the removal of a torn write**, which no reader ever counted and which
   §8 gives this command alone — its *Write the register and the round record* phase, or, on a run
   that skips that phase, *Resolve the round*'s no-new-round path.
   **Then complete any re-disposition an interrupted run left half-written**, now: for each `[CDF#n]`, take the latest `re-dispositioned` move any counted
   round record's `code defects:` line names for it — **the one with the highest move number `#k`**,
   never the one in the highest-numbered round, since a `--round N` re-open writes into an earlier
   round's record after later rounds exist (§8) — and where `code-defect-log.md` still reads that
   move's `<old>`, write its `<new>` — `blocked_on` added or dropped as the line says — and nothing
   else (§8). The record already names the move, so this writes nothing it does not count, and a
   log already reading `<new>`, or reading anything but `<old>`, is left alone. Report each move
   completed, and hand the log off with this run's deliverables; say in the report that the log stays
   uncommitted until a run of this command reaches its handoff, since a stop, an abort or a `Cancel`
   before this run's leaves it so, and the next run that reaches one stages it (*Handoff*). **Three changes to another run's record are the admitted exceptions, and naming
   them here is what keeps this sentence and the rules below from having to be refereed by a
   reader.** The first: a `[CDF#n]`'s `disposition` — with `blocked_on` added or dropped as the new
   disposition requires — may be re-taken by the *Put each `[V]` to the operator* phase and written
   by the *Write the register and the round record* phase, because `open` and `conditional` are
   holding states that would otherwise have no exit at all. The second: a decision reopened under
   `decision-register-format.md` §4, against one of the two causes it admits — the *Write the
   register and the round record* phase moves its `status` to `reopened` and appends the closing
   `Reopened <YYYYMMDD>:` paragraph §4 puts in its `argumentation`, against the original record's
   id — and the re-decision that follows it, in this same run or a later one, which writes the
   record's fields under §4's per-field rules and its argumentation after that paragraph, never over
   it or what stands above it (§4, which names that set and owns the reopen and the re-decision alike;
   the *Put each `[V]` to the operator* phase's picker and *The will-change rule* phase are where
   `options_considered`, `evidence` and `conditional_on` are taken). The reopen includes one this
   command makes on §4's first cause, against a `decided` `[VD#n]` or `[CD#n]` a re-grounding — a
   `--rebaseline` pass, or a verifier's `contradict` on an on-file finding — moved the ground under
   (*A decision the re-grounding moved*, in *Generate the round's question set*): on a `[CD#n]` it
   writes that `status` and that paragraph and nothing else, and the re-decision is
   `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s, from the customer's answer. The third: a
   `[VD#n]` reading `open` or `decided` whose question a later round re-put and answered — one the
   will-change rule held, or a reopened one whose `reopened` a propagation sweep's *Reverted* undid
   while its re-put question waited — the *Write the register and the round record* phase moves its
   `status` to `superseded` and appends the closing `Superseded <YYYYMMDD>: by [VD#m]` paragraph
   `decision-register-format.md` §4 fixes, naming the `[VD#n]` that answered the re-put question
   (*A decision the re-grounding moved*).
   Nothing else on any of the three records moves, and no other record here carries an exception. **An addition is not a rewrite, and one
   is made to another run's entry**: the `- **Requirement defect:**` line — with its
   `- **Defect image:**` line, where the defect sits on a row drawn from an image — that
   *Resolve the round* decides to add to a
   held `[C]` entry in `interview/customer-questions.md` (*One question per row*) and the *Write the
   register and the round record* phase writes, which changes nothing already written in it.

## Phase 1 — Classify + model routing

Invoke the `model-routing` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "workflows-core:model-routing"`), then record:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: MODERATE        # SIGNIFICANT for an unusually large question set, a first round
                                  # over a long inventory, or a re-open that reopens decisions
  reason: <one-line>
  current_model: <the model this orchestrator is running under>
  detection_model: <§2.1 Sonnet chain: claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6/4-5>   # impl-maintenance only — no other agent runs in this command
  opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
  notes: <any §2/§2.1 fallback or degradation>
```

`/brd-interview` dispatches no grounding or review agent of its own — every finding it reads was
already independently re-derived by `/prd-ground`'s `grounding-verifier` pass, and re-deriving it
here would be a second unverified opinion, not a second check. `detection_model` therefore exists
only for the terminal `impl-maintenance` dispatch. If no Opus resolves for `current_model`, degrade
to best-available, record it in `notes` and in the final report, and never hard-block.

---

## Phase 2 — Resolve the round

Rounds are numbered, permanent, contiguous, and resumable, and every decision records the round that
produced it (`interview-tagging.md` §5). This phase decides which round this run is working, and it
is the only phase that may create or re-open one.

Read every `interview/round-<N>.md` already on file.

### Terminal dispositions and holding states — the vocabulary every closure and resume rule uses

`interview-tagging.md` §5 is explicit that a disposition is **what happened to the question**, not
merely that somebody looked at it, and it names them: answered from findings (`[G]`), decided by the
delivery team with argumentation (`[V]`), answered by the customer through the review package
(`[C]`), re-tagged under §3, or split under §4. **Those five are terminal**, and this command calls
them **terminal dispositions**:

| Terminal disposition | Reached when |
|---|---|
| *answered from findings* | a verified finding settled a `[G]` |
| *decided* | a `[V]` produced a `[VD#n]` with its argumentation |
| *answered by the customer* | a `[C]`'s answer came back and an operator confirmed it (D14) |
| *re-tagged* | a `[G]` grounding could not settle changed tag, naming its cause; the re-tagged question then carries its own disposition |
| *split* | the question became parts, named; the parts carry their own dispositions |

**Everything else this command records against a question is a holding state, never a disposition**,
and a holding state keeps the round open:

| Holding state | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *held for the customer* | a `[C]` is written and waiting; **holding it is not the customer answering it** |
| *deferred* | recorded as not answerable yet, with why; it stays in this round and is returned to |
| *needs grounding* | no finding bears on a `[G]` yet; only a `/prd-ground` run can move it |
| *untagged* | the §2 test could not resolve it into exactly one tag; what is wrong with it is recorded and it is rewritten before it is asked |

**Why the distinction is load-bearing rather than tidy.** Every rule that reads a question's state
— this phase's resume rule, the *Write the register and the round record* phase's closure rule,
`/product-workflows:brd-package`'s gate on the rounds, and `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s
closing of a round its answers settle — is stated in this one vocabulary, so they cannot drift
apart. Were a holding state counted as a disposition, a round whose remainder sat in any holding
state — *deferred* or *needs grounding*, say — would close, and the resume rule would then skip past
the very question this run promised to return to. §5 sides with the holding states: *"A round with
an outstanding `[C]` stays open until that answer comes back through the package — the customer's
turnaround is not a reason to declare the round finished around them."*

A round is **open** while any question in it lacks a **terminal** disposition, and **closed** once
every one has one. **A question's state is the last one its record records at that question's
address**, the record being append-only: a re-tagged question carries the *re-tagged* disposition
and whatever it reached afterwards, both at the one number, and it is the later of the two that says
whether this question still lacks a terminal disposition (*Questions carry no minted identifier*, in
*Generate the round's question set*). **The dispositions decide a round's state, and nothing else
does**: its record's last `Status:` line records the result of each write (*Write the register and
the round record*), and where the two disagree the dispositions win.

**No `--round` flag:**

- **Some round is open** → work the lowest-numbered open round. Resume at its first question
  carrying **no terminal disposition** — which is exactly the question a holding state is holding —
  do not restart the round, and do not re-ask a question that already carries a terminal
  disposition. Re-asking a `[C]` is the case §5 singles out, and the register is the reason: two customer answers to one
  question is a contradiction one `[CD#n]` record has no way to hold.
- **No round record exists at all** → **generate round 1's questions first, then decide.** The *Every
  round is closed* branch below does not apply here: it generates from what changed "after the last
  round was generated", and no round has been, so it has no referent. Run *Round 1 is generated from the grounding* (below), and *A decision reopened elsewhere* over any register already on file — one `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile --sent` can leave on a slice never interviewed — and branch on what they
  produced:
  - **At least one question** → open round 1 and work it, exactly as ever.
  - **No question at all** — no finding whose verdict leaves the premise open (the first two
    sources: a premise that moved, and one the repository could not settle), no `will-change`
    horizon, no `[DG#n]` divergence, no `rejected` row not already settled, no `deferred-to` row
    whose consequence is unstated, no open requirement defect this BRD asks, nothing the
    package must assert without evidence, and, where a register is already on file, no record
    *A decision reopened elsewhere* puts again.
    **The test is the generation's own output, never a gloss on the verdicts**: `SUPERSEDED` raises
    no question and is neither `CONFIRMED` nor a reason to ask one, so a rule phrased over verdicts
    and a rule phrased over questions would disagree on a re-grounded corpus. Zero questions is the
    branch key. →
    **First run the in-scope scoping the generation depends on**, and where it empties the set take
    `BRD_INTERVIEW_ALL_DELEGATED` and stop: a BRD that kept none of its requirements has nothing of
    its own to decide, that stop forbids a round record outright, and it is reached *instead of* this
    branch rather than after it. Otherwise → **open round 1 to record the walk and what it found
    nothing of, closed in the same write** — it holds no question, so there is none to leave
    hanging, and a round left open would trap every later run on the resume rule and make the
    *Every round is closed* branch unreachable forever. Then carry on through the rest of the run —
    the register phase, which writes that record as it writes every round's (and which, recording no
    `[VD#n]`, no `[AS#n]` and no `[C]`, writes the register's header alone where none is on file,
    before it), the handoff, and the next-step offer. **The record is written there and not here**
    so that one phase writes every round's deliverables (*Write the register and the round
    record*); nothing between here and there can stop the run, so the choice moves no outcome. **This
    is a completed run, not a stop**: it produced a deliverable, so it stages and hands off like any
    other, and the offer it ends on is whichever *Next steps* selects from the `/brd-package` gates
    it checks — step 6's register, which this path has just written, and steps 7 and 8. With an open
    `[AS#n]` on file the packaging step is offered; with an empty register the run reports the BRD
    decided. The round record this path writes is also what step 8's interview test reads, so
    `BRD_PACKAGE_NOT_INTERVIEWED` bears on neither.

  **That record is not the empty round record the all-delegated stop forbids, and the difference is
  the whole of why one is written here and not there.** That rule refuses a record that *"would sit
  on file forever recording that nothing was asked, which reads indistinguishably from a round nobody
  finished"* — and it is right, about an **empty** file. This record is not empty: it names each of
  the seven question sources and states what the walk found under it, so a reader meets an account of a
  completed walk rather than a silence they have to interpret. The two also never compete, and the branch above is
  what makes that true rather than an assertion resting on it: the scoping check runs **first**, so
  an all-delegated BRD takes its own stop and never reaches the write.

  **Why the record is written rather than the run simply reporting and exiting.** The operator cannot
  know whether this BRD has anything to ask until this command has run, so the run is the discovery
  step and its result is worth keeping. It is also what `/product-workflows:brd-package` reads: that
  command refuses a BRD with no round record, and it must not re-derive the seven sources above to
  decide whether the refusal is fair — a second copy of this rule in another command is how the two
  drift apart, and the first question source added to one and not the other ships a package over a
  question nobody walked. It tests for the record; this branch is what makes an honest one exist.
- **Every round is closed** → **generate round `<highest + 1>`'s questions first, then decide** —
  the order the no-round-record branch takes, and for its reason: whether a round has anything to
  ask is the generation's output, never a gloss on what changed. A change is only where the
  generation looks (*A later round is generated from what changed*, in *Generate the round's
  question set*): a `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` added or superseded, or its verdict or verifier outcome
  changed, since the last round was generated — **read off that round's `generated against:` line**
  (*Write the register and the round record*), never off a date, which no finding carries: a finding
  on file that the line does not list and that does not read `SUPERSEDED` was added, one whose verdict or outcome differs from what the line
  records changed, and one it lists that now reads `SUPERSEDED` was superseded, whenever the change
  happened. **A round record written before that line existed carries none**, and there the anchor
  is the **earliest commit on any ref that holds the record exactly as it stands on disk** — the
  record is append-only, so that commit is where its current content was first committed. Take the
  record's blob with
  `blob=$(git -C "$SPECS_PATH" hash-object -- <the record's path relative to $SPECS_PATH>)`, list
  the candidates, newest first and never a parent before its children, with
  `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" log --all --date-order --format=%H -- <the record's path relative to $SPECS_PATH>`,
  and compare each candidate `<sha>`'s
  `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" rev-parse <sha>:./<the record's path relative to $SPECS_PATH>` to `$blob`,
  a candidate at which the record is absent matching nothing — the relative path in all three,
  since the `<sha>:./` form resolves only a path relative to `$SPECS_PATH`, and an absolute one
  there matches no candidate at all. The anchor is the **last** matching candidate in that
  order, resolved against the whole candidate set and never taken off its first line: a record
  committed only on another branch is found there, and one committed on a branch that still stands
  and then squash-merged is anchored at the branch commit, not the squash. Each grounding file is
  read at the anchor with `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" show <sha>:./<its path relative to $SPECS_PATH>`
  (the `./` form resolves from `$SPECS_PATH` whether or not it is the repository's top level), a
  file absent at `<sha>` holding no finding there, and compared the same way. **Git records when a
  record was committed, never when it was written**, so the comparison misses any grounding change committed
  before the anchor or in it — one made while that round was still open, before its last write,
  and one made after that write and committed no later than the record, which a squash commit or a
  late commit of the record carries. Where no candidate matches — the record, as it stands, in no commit any ref reaches — the
  comparison reads every finding as unchanged. **Whether or not a candidate matched, the run's
  final report names the anchor's outcome, on whichever branch below the generation takes, a round
  opened or not**: the no-match line, or the compared-at line and, where its test fires, the
  postdate caveat, each as the *No question at all* branch spells it.
  A change is also a requirement defect this BRD owns, that is open and that is not asked (*Round 1 is generated
  from the grounding* fixes all three tests), where round 1's record carries the requirement-defect
  account line: the round-1 walk did not raise it, and a new round is exactly where it belongs (the
  round-1 test below) — or a re-decision standing at round `<highest + 1>` that no record names
  (*A later round is generated from what changed*) — or a record *A decision the re-grounding moved* puts again: one the
  will-change rule held, every `evidence` finding of which now reads `SUPERSEDED` and has a
  successor, none of them still `will-change`, or one resting on a superseded finding no successor
  will come to, or a plain `decided` record any `evidence` finding
  of which reads `SUPERSEDED` and whose successors do not confirm its premise — **whenever that
  supersession happened**: a record whose findings a re-grounding superseded while an earlier round
  was still open was not put again by that round, and its supersession predating the last closure
  must not strand it — or a record *A decision reopened elsewhere* puts again: a `[VD#n]` or
  `[CD#n]` reading `reopened` that no question in flight puts, whichever run reopened it. **A change
  raises a question only where a source puts one**, and many do not: a `--rebaseline` pass
  supersedes every finding it re-grounds, shipped or not, so a pass whose successors confirm every
  plain record they bear on, and leave every held record waiting on its prerequisite, changes the
  files and raises nothing — every such successor is *A decision the re-grounding moved*'s to say,
  and that source says nothing. A record moved to `reopened` raises its question through *A decision
  reopened elsewhere*, and one moved to `superseded` raises nothing. Any other status another
  command writes — `withdrawn`, or a re-decision, completion or reversion written in place — raises
  nothing of itself either, since `reopened` is the one status a source here reads as a question.
  - **At least one question** → open round `<highest + 1>`, naming in its record exactly what
    changed and made it askable, and work it.
  - **No question at all** → **open no round** and write no round record: a round with nothing in it
    holds nothing for anyone to answer, and a record of one would read as a round nobody finished
    (*An empty in-scope set is a finished state*, in *Generate the round's question set*, refuses the
    same record for the same reason). Report it plainly — *nothing changed
    since round `<highest>` was generated* where nothing did, or, where something did, each change and why it raised
    nothing (below); where the fallback found an anchor, add *compared at `<short-sha>`, the earliest commit holding round `<highest>`'s record as it stands on disk, which misses a grounding change committed before it or in it*, and where that commit itself changed a file under `grounding/` — `git -C "<BRD-dir>" diff-tree --root -m --relative --no-commit-id --name-only -r <sha>` returns a path beginning `grounding/`, `<sha>` being the anchor, `<short-sha>` its abbreviated form, and `--relative` from `<BRD-dir>` what makes the paths this BRD's own and relative to its folder, a merge anchor included through `-m` — add *compared at `<short-sha>`, a commit that may postdate the record's write* after it: nothing git records tells a squash commit from an ordinary one, both having one parent, and a grounding change in the anchor itself is the one sign git does record that the grounding read there moved with the record rather than before it. Where no candidate matches, print *no commit on any ref holds round `<highest>`'s record as it stands on disk, so no finding change could be detected* in place of *nothing changed* where that would print, and beside the changes listed otherwise. Each change and why it raised
    nothing: a re-grounding as *re-grounded, nothing moved*, naming each plain record its successors
    confirmed and each held record still waiting on its prerequisite — run the round-1 test below — every round being closed, all it
    can do here is report — and, **where no `decisions.md` is on file, write it as its header line
    alone** (*Write the register and the round record*): a BRD interviewed before this command wrote
    the register on every round, over rounds that recorded no decision, holds none, and
    `/product-workflows:brd-package` refuses the folder without one. **Remove every torn write the
    *Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD* phase reported**, exactly as *Write the register and
    the round record* would (`decision-register-format.md` §8) — this path is a completed run that
    skips that phase, and a torn write left here would sit on file with nothing to remove it — and
    **report each one removed**, by id or heading with the round it claimed, in the final report.
    Then skip to the handoff phase — with nothing to commit where the register was already on file,
    nothing was torn, no re-disposition was completed and no earlier run left `code-defect-log.md`
    changed, and otherwise with the files this path wrote, removed a torn write from or completed a
    re-disposition in, and that log where an earlier run left it changed (*Handoff*) — and end on
    the ledger line.

**`--round N` given:**

- **Round `N` is open** → resume it, exactly as the no-flag path resumes it. The flag is not needed
  for this case; it is honoured for it so that naming a round is never a way to accidentally do
  something else.
- **Round `N` is closed** → **re-open it, and record the re-open with its cause.** Prompt for the
  cause and refuse to proceed without one. This is the same rule that governs reopening a decision
  (`decision-register-format.md` §4): a re-open whose cause is unnamed is indistinguishable from
  somebody changing their mind, and once one of those exists nobody can trust that the rest were
  caused either. Hold the re-open and its cause for the *Write the register and the round record*
  phase, which appends it to `interview/round-<N>.md` — never overwriting the record of what the
  round originally asked and how it was disposed of — and write nothing now: a run that stops before
  that phase leaves round `N` exactly as it stood, closed. Any decision this re-opened round then
  changes is itself reopened under §4, against one of the two causes that rule admits, and never
  merely because this round is open again.
  **The cause *requirement defects became a question source* is admissible on round 1 only, and
  only while round 1's record carries no account line** — once it carries one, a defect this source
  would raise belongs in a new round (the round-1 test below), so refuse that cause at the prompt
  and name the bare `/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>`. The re-open raises nothing itself:
  round 1 is open once it is taken, and the round-1 test below adds a question to round 1 for
  each requirement defect this BRD owns, that is open and that is **not asked** — one any slice has
  asked is never raised again, because two customer answers to one question is the contradiction §5
  exists to prevent — and gives round 1 its account line, both written by the *Write the register
  and the round record* phase. On an open round 1 no re-open is needed: the same test adds them as
  the run resumes it.
- **Round `N` does not exist** → stop rather than creating it out of order, which would break the
  contiguity §5 depends on:
  `BRD_INTERVIEW_NO_SUCH_ROUND: <BRD-KEY> has no round N — rounds on file: <list, or "none">. Omit --round to continue at the first round still holding a question without a terminal disposition.`
  The one exception: `N` is exactly `<highest + 1>` (or `1` when none exists), which is a request to
  open the next round, and takes **whichever branch the no-flag path would take for that same
  request** — the *Every round is closed* branch where rounds are on file and every one is closed,
  and the no-round-record branch where none is, each generating before it decides and each
  including its nothing-askable outcome. The two branches of *Resolve the round* differ, and a
  flag must not reach a different answer than the bare command would. Naming a round is never a way
  to accidentally do something else, and that cuts both ways: it must also never be a way to
  accidentally do *less*. **Where a lower round is open — some question in it carries no terminal
  disposition — the request has no branch to mirror**: the no-flag path would resume that round and
  open none, so opening round `<highest + 1>` beside it would be a different answer. Stop, naming
  the lowest-numbered open round and what holds it open:
  `BRD_INTERVIEW_ROUND_STILL_OPEN: <BRD-KEY> cannot open round N while round <open> is open — it still holds <each holding state a question in it is in>. <remedy> A new round opens once every round is closed.`
  `<remedy>` names one step per holding state the round holds, every one that applies, since each
  moves only by its own run. A round can hold any of four holding states (the table in *Terminal
  dispositions and holding states*):
  - *needs grounding* → `Ground the questions no finding bears on with '/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY>'.`;
  - *deferred* or *untagged* — or *needs grounding*, once grounded → `Resume round <open> with '/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>'.` — the operator answers a deferred question there, an untagged one is rewritten there, and a grounded one is answered there;
  - *held for the customer* → `Package the held questions with '/product-workflows:brd-package <BRD-KEY>', and record the customer's answers with '/product-workflows:brd-reconcile <BRD-KEY> @<review-file>'.` — no run of this command can close such a question.

  **Where round `<open>` holds more than one, name the steps in that order, the resume once.** The
  order is forced: `/product-workflows:brd-package`'s rounds gate (its Phase 0 step 7) refuses a
  BRD while any question is *deferred*, *needs grounding* or *untagged*, so the package can only
  follow the grounding pass and the resume.
  Nothing else here forbids two open rounds at once: a `--round N` re-open of a closed round while a
  later one is open is deliberate (the round-1 test below, and *Next steps*' `defects-unasked`).

**Then the round-1 test, on every run, whichever branch above resolved the round and with or
without `--round`.** No branch skips it: one that sends the run on to the handoff phase runs this
test first. Read round 1's record for the requirement-defect account line (*Write the
register and the round record*). **That line alone decides whether a requirement defect this BRD
owns, that is open and that is not asked belongs in round 1 or in a new round**; nothing else
decides that. Where it is a new round, **which** one is decided by what the branch above did with
this run — the round it opened on the defect's account, or the next one where it resumed a round
already open — and by nothing else either:

- **No round record exists** → round 1 is being generated now, from every source, so each such
  defect is raised in it and its record carries the line.
- **Round 1's record carries the line** → round 1's walk ran this source, so each such defect was not
  in front of it: confirmed since, by an intake re-run over a revised source, or withheld then and
  this BRD's to ask since. It belongs in a **new round**, and it is one of the changes that make one
  askable (the *Every round is closed* bullet above). **Which new round depends on what this run
  did, and the two cases part exactly there.** Where the *Every round is closed* branch opened a
  round on this defect's account — naming it in that round's record among the changes that made the
  round askable — it is raised **in that round**, and this run's account line records it asked, like
  any other question of that round. A round opened for a defect and then withheld from it opens
  holding nothing, so nothing closes it, the next run resumes it and withholds the defect again, and
  a `[C]` only the customer can settle is never asked while the printed remedy names the round that
  is already open. Where this run instead **worked a round it did not open on this defect's
  account** — one an earlier run left open, or one `--round N` re-opened for some other cause — it
  waits, as a changed finding does, since that round's question set was settled without this defect
  in it and a later round is where what became askable since belongs. A defect that waits is
  **reported, never silent**: name each waiting `[DEF#n]`, *asked
  in round `<highest + 1>`, once round `<open>` closes*, in the final report and beside the *Next
  steps* list, and withhold it in this run's account line with the cause `waits — round <open>
  still open`, since a package built meanwhile goes out without it.
- **Round 1's record carries no line** → this slice was interviewed before the requirement-defect
  source existed, so every such defect belongs in **round 1** — a question round 1 could have asked
  stays in round 1, never in a new round (*Generate the round's question set*: a later round holds
  only what became askable after the previous round's questions were written):
  - **Round 1 is open** → no re-open is needed. Where this run works round 1 — the bare path always
    does, round 1 being the lowest-numbered open round, and so does a run that has just re-opened
    it — add a question for each to round 1's set now, numbered after its last question and never
    renumbering one, and hold them, with round 1's account line, for the *Write the register and
    the round record* phase, which appends both to round 1's record. Nothing is written now. A `--round N` run
    working another open round leaves them for the next run that works round 1.
  - **Round 1 is closed** → open no round for them. Report each `[DEF#n]` and name the re-open that
    asks them: `/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY> --round 1`, with the cause *requirement
    defects became a question source*. A round this run opens or resumes for any other cause
    proceeds without them, and the *Next steps* phase offers the re-open.

**One question per row, whichever branch above places the defect.** A defect this BRD owns as its
carrier (*Round 1 is generated from the grounding*) is asked on its rejected row's question, never
beside it. So where some round already holds that row's question — the
`interview/customer-questions.md` entry whose `- **Rejected row:**` line names it, or, on an entry
written before 3.7.0, which carries no such line, the one held entry whose question names that row's
`[BR#n]` and asks about its rejection — and that question is still *held for the customer*, the
defect is asked by **appending its `- **Requirement defect:** [DEF#n]` line to that entry** — with
its `- **Defect image:**` line after it where the defect sits on a row drawn from an image (*Hold
every `[C]`*) — not by a question of its own. The question text is not rewritten; the line is an
addition, and it is what makes the defect **asked** and lets `/brd-reconcile` settle it from the
answer. The run that works the round holding the entry makes the addition and records the defect
asked in that round's account line; a run working another round leaves it for that one, and reports
it as waiting on that round. **The addition is decided here and held, not written**: the *Write the
register and the round record* phase appends the line with the rest of the round's deliverables,
and the account line naming it goes into the round record that phase writes last
(`decision-register-format.md` §8), so a run that stops first leaves the entry as it found it.
Where no held entry is the row's — none names it, more than one could be it, or its question was
already answered — a question is raised in the round the branches above place it in, and the final
report names any candidates it could not choose between. **An earlier answer does not settle it**:
`/brd-reconcile` copies `settles` from the entry's labelled line when it freezes the answer, and an
answer frozen before the line existed carried none, so the defect is asked anew — its question
states what the defect records and names that earlier `[CD#n]` as context, so the customer sees what
they already said about the row.

Carry the resolved round number for the whole run. Every decision, assumption and question this run
records is stamped with it.

---

## Phase 3 — Generate the round's question set

Write the round's questions **before tagging any of them**, so the set is generated by what the BRD
needs settled rather than by what would be convenient to route.

**Where *Resolve the round* has already generated the round it opens, this phase works that set and
generates nothing again.** That phase's no-round-record branch runs the scoping below, *Round 1 is
generated from the grounding* and *A decision reopened elsewhere* to learn whether there is a round
to open at all, and its *Every
round is closed* branch does the same for a later round (*A later round is generated from what
changed*, below), so both have run once already, and a second pass would write a second copy of the
same questions. **Nor does it
generate on a round it resumes or re-opens, whatever the cause**: a resumed or re-opened round's
questions are on file, and the only questions a run adds to one — round 1 open or re-opened
included — are those the round-1 test and *One question per row* add (*Resolve the round*), so
this phase generates nothing beyond them. Everything else this phase fixes — how a question is
numbered and addressed, and which round a question belongs in — binds that set exactly as it binds
one generated here.

**Scope the set to the rows this BRD is answerable for, before generating anything.** Read
`<BRD-dir>/coverage-ledger.md` and take the rows whose `disposition` is `covered-here`,
`deferred-to`, `rejected` or `superseded-by`, **less every orphan row** — a ledger row for a
`[BR#n]` this slice's `brd-link.md` `claims:` no longer names (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §2's
term). **A row `covered-by: <OTHER-KEY>` is out of scope as a subject**: §3 of
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` says that BRD *owns* the requirement,
and §3.1 there is the authority for what that means here — the owning BRD's own round asks about it,
and a question raised at both levels reaches the customer twice, which
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/interview-tagging.md` §5 names as an invitation to two
contradictory answers one `[CD#n]` cannot hold. **An orphan row is out of scope whatever it reads**
(§3.1 there), for the same reason: the parent's walk withdrew this slice's claim and settled the row elsewhere, so
where it settled it `rejected: [DEF#n]` or `superseded-by: [BR#n]` the orphan row carries that
disposition across unchanged (§3's orphan table) and reads exactly like a row this slice rejected or
superseded itself — and the decision it records is the parent's, not this slice's to put to anyone.

**Read the `disposition` column for a row's fate, never the inventory — and `claims:` for exactly
one test, the orphan test above, and for nothing else.** A row's fate is the ledger's to say, and a
stale inventory would otherwise put a withdrawn row back in scope. The orphan test is the one
question this slice's ledger cannot answer, since an orphan row's disposition is the parent's
settled fate copied onto it, and `claims:` is the record that says the claim was withdrawn — the
`claims:` entry and the copied inventory row are withdrawn together (`coverage-ledger-format.md`
§2). Every other test of a row's fate this command makes — the live and carrier tests below among
them — reads a ledger's `disposition` column. Report the scope in the round record — held, like
every entry below, for the *Write the register and the round record* phase to write — and in the
final report — how many rows this round covers, how many were left to the BRDs that own them, named, and
each orphan row passed over, with the disposition it carries — so a short round reads as scoped
rather than as thin.

**A delegated row is still readable as context.** What this BRD keeps may turn on what it gave away,
and a question about a `covered-here` row may cite a delegated one to make sense. What is forbidden
is the delegated row being the thing asked about; the test is whose answer would settle it.

**A row this slice does not claim is cited qualified, as `<PARENT-KEY> [BR#n]`** — the one prose
spelling `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.2 gives another BRD's id,
`<PARENT-KEY>` being this slice's `parent:`, the BRD whose numbering every `[BR#n]` is. The package
carries this slice's own inventory, which holds only the rows the slice claims (`brd-format.md`
§2.1), so a bare `[BR#n]` naming an orphan row, a sibling's row or a row the root settled resolves
to nothing there and `/product-workflows:brd-package` stops on it as a dead citation; relation 1
there discharges the qualified form. Which form a row takes is read off that same inventory, the
corpus relation 1 resolves against — a row it holds is cited bare — and never off `claims:`. This
binds every question this run writes and everything written from one — the held entry the *Hold
every `[C]`* phase builds and *Write the register and the round record* writes, the `[VD#n]` or `[AS#n]` a question becomes, and, one command later, the
`[CD#n]` `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` freezes from the customer's answer, in every field but
the customer's own quoted words (its *Freeze the customer decisions* phase) — and above all the
context rows a requirement defect's question names (below), which routinely sit in another slice.

**An empty in-scope set is a finished state, and scoping is what makes it reachable.** A slice
every one of whose ledger rows is an orphan row — each claim it made withdrawn by its parent's walk,
the row now `covered-by` another BRD or carrying a fate the parent settled — kept none of its
requirements and has nothing of its own to decide. Its inventory holds no row, each claim's row
having been withdrawn with it, but the *Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD* phase counts
inventory rows only where the grounding is on no ref at all, so `BRD_INTERVIEW_EMPTY_INVENTORY`
never fires on a slice whose grounding is on main, and this is the gate that sees it. Do not open a
round for it and do not write an empty round record: a round record is append-only and permanent
(`interview-tagging.md` §5), and an empty one would sit on file forever recording that nothing was
asked, which reads indistinguishably from a round nobody finished. Report it and stop gracefully:
`BRD_INTERVIEW_ALL_DELEGATED: every row of <BRD-KEY>'s coverage-ledger.md is an orphan row — a claim the walk of its parent <PARENT-KEY> withdrew, now covered-by another BRD or given a fate <PARENT-KEY> settled — so this slice is answerable for no requirement and has nothing to decide: a row covered by another BRD is asked there, on its own key, and a fate the parent settled is not this slice's to put to the customer. This is a finished state, not a missing step: a slice that kept nothing also holds no PRD of its own (coverage-ledger-format.md §5). Re-running '/product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY>' on this slice moves nothing: it walks only unallocated rows, and this ledger has none. Re-run /product-workflows:brd-split on <PARENT-KEY> instead: it resolves every standing empty child, so it will offer to remove this slice or to keep it against a recorded reason — the bare '/product-workflows:brd-split <PARENT-KEY>' where that ledger leaves no row unallocated, and '/product-workflows:brd-split <PARENT-KEY> "<how to cut it>"' where it does. Where it leaves none, an instruction on that run, '/product-workflows:brd-split <PARENT-KEY> "<what to peel off>"', can also re-cut onto this slice a row a sibling has recorded, in its own ledger, that it will not build — only while this slice has never been interviewed. A row its holder is still committed to is moved by no command: un-delegating that one is a decision taken with the customer.`
This stop is an allocation outcome, never a plugin gap, so it does not fire `emit-block`.

**Round 1 is generated from the grounding.** Work the verified findings and the in-scope rows
together — and, for requirement defects, the parent's defect log, inventory and ledger and the
sibling slices' ledgers and question sets that decide who asks one (*Resolve inputs and gate the
grounded BRD*, step 9) — and raise a question wherever they leave something unsettled that a PRD
would have to state:

- a `[BR#n]` whose findings are `AMENDED`, `REWRITTEN` or `FALSE-FRIEND` — the premise moved, so what
  the requirement now asks for is open (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §3);
- a `[BR#n]` whose findings are `NOT-PROVABLE` — the repository could not settle it, and somebody
  must now choose. **This list raises questions; it does not tag them**, and a question raised here
  arrives at the *Tag every question* phase **carrying the finding that raised it**, so that phase
  tags it for a person — `[V]`, or `[C]` where what the repository could not settle turns out to be
  a business question (`interview-tagging.md` §1, §3). It never arrives as a `[G]`, which is why
  the *Answer every `[G]` from the findings* phase's re-tag route covers a different provenance and
  not this one;
- a finding carrying `horizon: will-change` — what this BRD does while the naming prerequisite
  decision is unbuilt is open by construction (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §5);
- a `[DG#n]` reconciliation the design and the requirement disagree about (§6's classes);
- an in-scope ledger row resolved `rejected`, unless its rejection is already settled. **Nothing on
  the route records why a row was rejected** — `/brd-split` collects a rationale for a `deferred-to`
  row only, into `slices.md` (its Phase 5) — so a rejection's consequence for the rest of the BRD is
  unstated by construction, and whether the customer accepts not getting what they asked for is
  theirs to say: the question is `[C]` (`interview-tagging.md` §1). A `rejected` row is **already
  settled**, and raises nothing, where it reads `rejected: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]` — the customer's own
  decision withdrew it (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3) — or where the `[DEF#n]` it cites is no
  longer `open` in the log, is **asked** (the next bullet's test), is **owned through a live row by
  any slice under the same parent, this one included**, or is carried by another slice (below). A
  defect of the five classes the next bullet asks, owned through a live row, is raised by that
  bullet in the slice that owns it, and its question names every row the defect joins as context,
  this row among them — so a question of this row's own would put one row to the customer twice, in
  this slice or across two. An `unsourced` defect joins a live row as well only in a log entry
  written before the one-row listing, which records every row in one list (`brd-format.md` §4); it
  is grounding's to settle, where the requirement is still live — the owning slice's findings on
  that row decide whether its premise holds, and one they cannot decide is already a question under
  the `NOT-PROVABLE` bullet above — so this row raises nothing for it either, and its log entry
  stays `open` until a person resolves it: `resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CG#n]` is a value
  `brd-format.md` §4 admits and `/product-workflows:brd-package` resolves, and **no command on this
  route writes it** — not this one, and not `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`, which produces no
  finding. That is a hand-written resolution with a reader, not a resolution with no writer. **A row
  `rejected: [DEF#n]` carries that defect** on its question's `- **Requirement defect:**` line
  (*Hold every `[C]`*) where this BRD is the defect's **carrier**: no row the defect joins is live
  (the next bullet's test), and of the rows it joins that a slice claims and records `rejected`
  citing it, this BRD holds the lowest-numbered (the next bullet's carrier test, which never counts
  an orphan row) — which makes this BRD its owner, whatever the defect's class (the account line
  counts a carried defect of any class, *Write the register and the round record*). The question
  then states what the defect records, exactly as the next bullet's question does, counts as asking
  it, and `/brd-reconcile` settles it, `resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]`, on the customer's answer.
  One question, never two: the next bullet raises no second one for a defect this row carries. Where
  the next bullet's undecidable states hold, the row is withheld with its defect, for the reason
  that bullet gives. **A `deferred-to` row raises no question where its consequence is stated** — in
  the `slices.md` block `/brd-split` writes for each row it defers, or in the `[CD#n]` whose
  customer deferred it; one carrying neither raises a question, tagged by the *Tag every question*
  phase's test like any other;
- an **open requirement defect** — a `[DEF#n]` in `brd/brd-defect-log.md` (the parent's on a slice,
  one hop — `brd-format.md` §4) whose resolution is `open` and whose class grounding cannot settle:
  `ambiguity`, `conflict`, `duplicate`, `untestable` or `scope-leak`. `unsourced` is not in the
  list: grounding settles it, and a finding that could not is already a question under the
  `NOT-PROVABLE` bullet above. **Which BRD asks is read off the log entry and the ledgers**: the
  defect's rows are **every row it joins** — the one row its entry is raised on and every row the
  entry `names` (`brd-format.md` §4), read off the parent's log on a slice — so a split whose first
  row no slice builds is still owned through a sibling row one does. An inventory written before the
  one-row listing rule may list a `conflict` or `duplicate` in a counterpart's `defects` column too;
  that row is one the entry names anyway. **Ownership is decided over the live ones only.** A row
  the defect joins is **live** where the parent's `coverage-ledger.md` records it `covered-by` a
  slice and that slice records it `covered-here` or `deferred-to` in its own ledger — read one hop,
  from each such slice under the same parent, this one included. The defect is **owned** by the
  slice holding the **lowest-numbered live row** it joins. A row the parent never delegated (no
  `covered-by`), or whose owning slice records it `rejected` or `superseded-by`, is not live.
  **Where no row it joins is live, the defect's carrier owns it** — the slice holding the
  lowest-numbered row it joins that the parent's ledger records `covered-by` that slice and the
  slice records `rejected: [DEF#n]` citing this defect, so an orphan row carrying the parent's own
  rejection never makes its slice a carrier — and asks it on that row's question (the bullet above),
  carrying it on the labelled line; this bullet raises no second question for it, in whichever round
  it is asked. Where there is no carrier either — every row it joins `superseded-by`, never
  delegated, or rejected citing something else — **no slice owns it, and this route never puts it to
  the customer**: the defect stays `open` in the log, and the account line of a slice whose in-scope
  set holds one of its rows withholds it as `no live row`, naming each row and its disposition.
  **One such defect is named by no account line at all**: where every row it joins was settled by
  the root's own walk — deferred, rejected or superseded there, never delegated — no slice's
  in-scope set holds any of them. Such a row sits in no slice's ledger save as an **orphan row** of
  a slice that once claimed it — reading the root's `rejected` or `superseded-by`, or `covered-by`
  the root where the root kept it — and an orphan row is out of scope there (*Scope the set*,
  above), so it is not asked there either; and the root is never interviewed (Phase 0,
  `BRD_INTERVIEW_ROOT_LEVEL`). That is a limit of the route, stated rather than worked around: the
  root's ledger records each row's fate, and the defect stays `open` beside it. **This BRD raises
  the defect only where it owns it, it is open, and it is not asked.** A `[DEF#n]` is **asked**
  exactly where some slice under the same parent — found by the positive `brd-link.md` parent test
  (`commands/brd-split.md` Phase 0), this one included — has an `interview/customer-questions.md`
  entry whose `- **Requirement defect:**` line carries it, the line the *Hold every `[C]`* phase
  builds or *One question per row* adds, and no other mention in the entry — **an entry, and a line,
  that is not a torn write** (`decision-register-format.md` §8): one no round record of its slice
  names was put to nobody, and counting it would leave the defect asked by no one. That is a
  structured fact read across the slices, never a search of round records for the id — the round
  records are read only to say which entries and lines they name — so this source never
  raises a defect asked once again, whichever slice asked it and whoever owns it now. **An answer the
  will-change rule held `open` keeps its defect `asked` and `open` alike** — the entry still carries
  the line, and `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` resolves nothing from a `[CD#n]` it froze `open` —
  so this source does not raise it again, and it reaches the customer a second time only on the
  question that re-puts that record (*A decision the re-grounding moved*, below). One the rule held
  `conditional_on` its prerequisite is `decided`, and resolved its defect when it was frozen
  (`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`, *Resolve the defects the review settled*), so that defect is
  no longer `open` and nothing here raises it. **Four states make the
  answer undecidable, and each withholds the defect**: a row it joins still `unallocated` — in the
  parent's ledger, or in the ledger of the slice the parent names — which may become live later and
  take it; a sibling ledger that cannot be read; a sibling `customer-questions.md` that exists
  and cannot be read — an absent one holds no entry; and a sibling round record that exists and
  cannot be read, where an entry carrying the defect claims that round — an absent one names
  nothing, so its entries are torn writes and count for nothing. This BRD raises nothing about such a defect and
  reports it with the row or the sibling named — never a guess, because a guess asks the customer
  twice or not at all. **Which round a raised defect goes into is *Resolve the round*'s to decide**,
  by round 1's account line and, where that line sends it to a new round, by which round this run
  resolved. Every other row the defect joins is context for the question, a rejected row of any
  slice included — each one this slice does not claim cited as
  `<PARENT-KEY> [BR#n]` (*A row this slice does not claim*, above). **The question states what the
  defect records** — the two readings, the two requirements that cannot both hold, the missing
  observable outcome — and, where the row is drawn from an image (`brd-format.md` §2), names the
  image's path, which the customer holds in the bundle. **It cites a passage of the customer's by
  its captured path and locator** — `source/<basename> › § 4.2`, never a bare `§ 4.2`, which
  `/brd-package`'s plugin-free scan stops on and whose path form
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.3 rule 1 exempts. It is `[C]`
  (`interview-tagging.md` §1);
- anything the package will have to **assert without evidence** — that is not a question at all but
  an `[AS#n]`, and the *Write the register and the round record* phase records it as one
  (`decision-register-format.md` §7).

**A decision the re-grounding moved is put again — one source, two cases.** A
`/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> --rebaseline` pass re-grounds every claim against the moved
code, writes each result as a new finding, and marks the finding it replaces `verdict: SUPERSEDED`,
id retained, the verdict it carried kept as `prior_verdict`, every other field as it stood
(`workflows-core:grounding-format` §2, §3, §5). **Any `/product-workflows:prd-ground` run does the
same to an on-file finding its verifier contradicts**, at the same commit: the finding is superseded
the same way, and a successor carrying the verifier's verdict, with the same `claim`, `commit` and
`horizon`, is appended with the next id (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §8); **and to an on-file
finding whose horizon or prerequisite its *Horizons* phase moves**, whose successor carries the same
verdict and evidence and the new horizon (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §5). A record in
`decisions.md` **any one of whose `evidence` findings reads `SUPERSEDED`** rests, in that part, on
ground no longer on file, and this source takes it — as a *held* record or as a *plain* one, told
apart by the record's own fields below.
**Any, not every**: a supersession replaces findings one at a time, and a verifier's `contradict`
routinely supersedes one finding of a record's list and leaves the rest standing, so a source that
waited for the whole list would leave that record `decided` on a premise the code no longer shows
(`decision-register-format.md` §4, cause 1). A finding of the list that does not read `SUPERSEDED`
**stands as cited**: no test below reads it, and no successor is sought for it. Two records it never
takes, and none while it is in flight. **One whose `evidence` names no finding** —
`evidence: []`, or any `[AS#n]`, whose `evidence` holds the statement of why no evidence exists
rather than finding ids (`decision-register-format.md` §7): it rests on no finding, so no finding of
its list can read `SUPERSEDED` (`decision-register-format.md` §6).
**And a `[CD#n]` frozen `open` for want of its reason** — the one
`open` record whose `argumentation` names its reason absent (`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`,
*Confirm every candidate*): its question is still *held for the customer* and travels in the next
package, so a question put here as well would reach the customer twice for one decision. It becomes
this source's only once a later review supplies the reason and completes it. **Nor, while it is in
flight, does it take any record** (*A decision reopened elsewhere*, below, fixes the test): a
question already putting that record again is still waiting for its answer, and a second question
would put one decision twice. A held record whose re-put `[V]` the operator deferred, or whose
re-put `[C]` is still held for the customer, is the case this would bar, which no current path
reaches (the in-flight test's own paragraph says why).

**A superseded finding's successors are read off the grounding files and nothing else**: every
finding on file that passes all four of these tests against it —
1. **the same prefix**, `[CG#n]` or `[DG#n]`;
2. **a `verdict` that is not `SUPERSEDED`**;
3. **a `claim` opening with the same requirement id** — each grounder writes the id first
   (`agents/code-grounder.md`, `agents/design-grounder.md`) — **or, where the superseded finding's
   `claim` is the literal `none — frame-only`**, a class-1 `[DG#n]` reconciling a frame against no
   requirement (`agents/design-grounder.md`), **a `claim` reading that same literal and citing the
   same frames**: the paths of its `evidence` that its frame set's index names are exactly the
   superseded finding's. With no requirement id to match, the match is on the frame set — test 4
   places both in one — and on the frames of it each cites, read off the parsed `evidence` paths
   against that index and never off prose; a match on the set alone would let a finding on one
   frame stand as the successor of a finding on another, confirming a divergence the frames no
   longer show. **The frames cannot tell two findings on one frame apart**, though — one frame can
   diverge from the inventory in two ways, over two fields, and carry a frame-only finding for each —
   so **where more than one other frame-only `[DG#n]` on file in that set, superseded or not, cites
   any frame the superseded finding cites, this branch cannot be decided**: a successor it picked
   could be the other divergence's, confirming one the frames no longer show. A plain record resting
   on such a finding is then reopened, and a held one is put again (below), since no finding on file
   is ever deleted and the branch stays undecidable;
4. **grounded against the same source, and minted after it** — a higher id of that prefix. The
   source is read off records already on file, never off the finding's prose, because
   `/product-workflows:prd-ground` grounds every claim once per repository and once per frame set
   (its *Fan out grounding* phase) and a `--rebaseline` pass re-grounds only the repositories
   whose `HEAD` moved, so a sibling repository's or a sibling frame set's finding on the same
   requirement id is not a successor. **A `[CG#n]`'s source is its repository**: the one
   repository whose `<BRD-dir>/grounding/baselines.md` entry records a pin equal to the finding's `commit`
   — that file is appended to, never overwritten, so the pin a superseded finding was grounded
   against still resolves. **A `[DG#n]`'s source is its frame set**: the one
   `<BRD-dir>/design/<frame-set>/` whose index names every path of the finding's `evidence` that any
   set's index names, there being at least one such path (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §6.2) —
   a finding record carries no frame-set field, and a design finding's `evidence` may cite code
   paths beside its frames, which no index names and which so take no part in the placement.

Where a test cannot be decided — a `claim` opening with no requirement id and not reading
`none — frame-only`, a frame-only finding whose frames more than one other frame-only finding
cites (test 3), a `commit` no
`baselines.md` entry records or that more than one repository's entry records, a `[DG#n]` whose
evidence names no path any index names, or whose named paths no single set's index holds all of —
it is not passed. A superseded finding
that no finding on file passes all four against has **no successor**, and every test below reads
that as a test that did not pass.

- **A held record** — one the will-change rule held: every finding in its `evidence` carries
  `horizon: will-change`, which superseding leaves as it was, and it stands `open`, or `decided` with a
  `conditional_on` — a `[VD#n]` *The will-change rule* phase resolved by deferral or by condition, or
  a `[CD#n]` `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s *Freeze the customer decisions* phase froze
  conditional or open. Its question was closed — *decided*, or *answered by the customer* — so no
  resume returns to it: another answer against the same findings fires the same test, which is why
  the record waits rather than its question. **It is put again once every finding in its `evidence`
  reads `SUPERSEDED`, each has a successor, and no successor of any of them carries
  `horizon: will-change`.** A
  `--rebaseline` pass keeps `will-change` on a successor until the naming decision ships
  (`commands/prd-ground.md` Phase 6), and it supersedes every finding it re-grounds whether or not
  anything shipped — so a supersession alone observes nothing, and **the observation that the
  prerequisite shipped is a successor no longer `will-change`**. A record with a successor still
  `will-change`, or with some of its findings superseded and some not, rests on ground still about to
  move: it **waits on its prerequisite**, and the final report names it with each such successor and
  the prerequisite it names, raising nothing. **One with a superseded finding no successor will come
  to is put again instead**, as a plain record would be, naming that finding and which of the two
  reasons below holds, since waiting would wait for good. **No successor will come to a superseded
  finding that has none, in exactly two cases**, each read off the grounding files:
  - **it cannot be matched to one** — its own source cannot be decided, a `commit` no
    `baselines.md` entry records or more than one records, or a `[DG#n]` the frame-set placement in
    test 4 does not settle, so test 4 can pass nothing against it; or it is a frame-only finding
    whose frames more than one other frame-only finding cites, so test 3 can pass nothing against
    it. Either stays true whatever any later run writes, since no finding on file is ever deleted;
  - **the run that retired it re-ground its source**: the finding, or a finding on file that passes
    tests 1, 3 and 4 against it — its chain of successors, every one now `SUPERSEDED` —
    carries the note `superseded: frame set <frame-set> re-ground`, matched exactly, with
    `<frame-set>` the set test 4 places it in. `/product-workflows:prd-ground`'s frame-set rule
    writes that note only on a finding whose set that run's design pass reconciled, so that
    re-grounding looked for a successor to it and found none — a divergence the frames no longer
    show — and no later run owes it one.

  One with a superseded finding that has no successor and is in neither case waits, named with that
  finding: its source is readable and no re-grounding of it has yet run, so a later one can write the
  ground its question is put against — the class-4 finding a cascade retired, whose note names that
  run, is the ordinary case. A finding either case reaches is left as it stands on file; nothing
  migrates it. **This round is not its only exit**: one written
  `conditional_on` is also reached by `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s propagation sweep the day
  its prerequisite's decision moves, which may revert it or reopen it in place
  (`decision-register-format.md` §5, §6), and that sweep's citation pass reaches a held record of
  either kind that names an id its reconciliation changed.
- **A plain record** — `status: decided` and not held. `decision-register-format.md` §4's first
  cause, a finding that supersedes one in its `evidence`, may reopen it, and this is what does.
  **It is reopened unless its successors confirm its premise, by this test and no other**, run
  **per superseded finding**: a superseded finding confirms only where it carries a
  `prior_verdict`, it has a successor, and every successor carries a `verdict` equal to that
  `prior_verdict` and a `horizon` equal to the finding's own — which superseding leaves as it
  stood. **The record is confirmed only where every superseded finding in its `evidence`
  confirms**; one that does not reopens it. A finding of the list that does not read `SUPERSEDED`
  takes no part in the test and stands as cited. **Equal, not `current`**: a plain record may rest
  on one `current` finding and one `will-change` one, which §6 leaves `decided` because the
  `current` one is ground that holds (`decision-register-format.md` §6), and a pass run before the
  prerequisite ships re-grounds the second as `will-change` again — the ground as it stood, which
  confirms. The pass after it ships writes that successor `current`, a horizon the finding did not
  carry, so the record is reopened then: the move from `will-change` to `current` is the
  prerequisite's shipping, and the premise the record was decided on has changed. **The test is the
  same for a `[VD#n]` and a `[CD#n]`**, and
  it reads the grounding files alone: `prior_verdict` is the verdict the finding carried when it was
  superseded, which the superseding run writes into the block (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §2),
  so no register, round record or question entry is consulted for it. **Where a superseded finding
  carries no `prior_verdict`, has no successor, or any successor carries another verdict or another
  horizon, the record is reopened** — the question is put rather than a confirmation assumed. A
  finding superseded before `prior_verdict` existed carries none, so its prior verdict is unknown and
  the record resting on it is reopened; that prior verdict is never inferred from the finding's
  `notes`, nor from a `[C]` entry's `- **Findings:**` line, which records the verdicts a question
  was put against and not the ones a supersession overwrote. **A record whose successors confirm raises
  nothing, and nothing on it moves** — the ground was re-derived and came back as it stood.
  The reopen is written by the *Write the register and the round record* phase of the run that puts
  the question, and never before: `status: reopened`, and a closing `Reopened <YYYYMMDD>:` paragraph
  appended to its `argumentation` naming as its cause every successor of every superseded finding
  in its `evidence`, each with its verdict and horizon, and each superseded finding that has none
  (`decision-register-format.md` §4). The two go together, and this source never leaves a record
  reopened without its question. A run that stops between the register and the round record does
  leave one: the reopen stands (§8), and its question is lost with the round record. This source
  takes only `open` and `decided` records, so it does not take a `reopened` one again. *A decision
  reopened elsewhere* (below) does: no question in flight puts it, and that source puts its question in the
  next round opened.

Such a record — a held one ready to be put again, a held one resting on a superseded finding
no successor will come to, or a plain one its successors do not confirm — is
a question that makes a new round askable (*Resolve the round*, the *Every round is closed*
bullet), and **it is raised in the round this run opens**, one question per record, never in a round
it resumes or re-opens — that round's question set is settled — and where this run works an open
round instead, it is reported as waiting on that round, like a changed finding, and raised (a plain
record reopened with it) in the next one opened. The question:

- **carries the tag of the question it re-puts** — `[V]` for a `[VD#n]`, `[C]` for a `[CD#n]` — and
  arrives at *Tag every question* carrying it, which that phase records rather than re-derives. **The
  tag never moves on a question put again**: the answer's prefix is fixed by the tag
  (`decision-register-format.md` §1), a record is replaced or re-decided only by an answer of its own
  authority, and a `[V]` answered by a customer or a `[C]` by the operator would leave the record with
  an answer of the other register and no exit that reads it;
- **is put against the current findings** — every successor, each with its verdict and horizon,
  and every finding of its `evidence` that does not read `SUPERSEDED`, as it stands, which for a
  `[C]` are its `- **Findings:**` line — and names the record and what it chose as context, so
  whoever answers sees what was answered before and why it is asked again;
- **carries a `- **Re-puts:**` line naming the record** — `- **Re-puts:** [VD#n]` or
  `- **Re-puts:** [CD#n]` — on the question in the round record, whatever its tag (*Write the
  register and the round record*), and for a `[C]` on its held entry as well (*Hold every `[C]`*).
  That line is how every reader ties the question to the record it puts again, and none reads the
  question's context for it, which names the earlier answer too. For a `[C]` putting a held record
  whose `settles` names a `[DEF#n]` still `open` in the log, the entry carries that id on its
  `- **Requirement defect:**` line too, with the `- **Rejected row:**` and `- **Defect image:**`
  lines the answered entry carried (*Hold every `[C]`*) — so `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`
  copies `settles` into the answering `[CD#n]` and settles the defect from it. **That defect is the
  one a later question carries after it was asked**: the *asked* test above counts it asked, so the
  requirement-defect source never raises it again, and the re-put question is how it reaches the
  customer the second time — as the question its earlier answer could not close, never as a second
  question beside one still standing. A reopened record's question carries no
  `- **Requirement defect:**` line, whichever source puts it: its `settles` stands under §4, and the defect it names keeps the resolution
  `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s *Resolve the defects the review settled* phase wrote when the
  record was first written `decided` (frozen so, or completed from `open`) — `resolved-by: <SLICE-KEY>/[CD#n]` naming this record, or a `withdrawn` or
  `customer-amended` resolution naming no id at all (`brd-format.md` §4).

**What the answer does turns on the record's `status` as the answer's writer reads it**, read off
the record and never judged. For a `[V]`, that is when this command writes the answer — or, for a
plain record this run reopens, the `reopened` the same register write gives it: the answer and that
reopen are written together, by the *Write the register and the round record* phase, so the record
still reads `decided` while the operator answers. For a `[C]`, it is the register as it stood before
the `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` run that freezes the answer wrote anything, which that
command reads every status from (its *Freeze the customer decisions* phase). A
record reading `reopened` — a plain one this source reopened, in this run or an earlier one, a
held one written `conditional_on` that a propagation sweep reopened while its question waited, or
one *A decision reopened elsewhere* (below) puts again — is **re-decided in place** under §4,
keeping its id, the record being the one the question's `- **Re-puts:**` line names: a `[V]` by
*Put each `[V]` to the operator*'s re-decision rule, a `[C]` by
`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` from the answering entry's line. One reading `open` or `decided`
— a held record, `open` or `conditional_on`, or a reopened one whose `reopened` a propagation
sweep's *Reverted* undid while its question waited, the reversion restoring its `status` with the
rest of the position (`decision-register-format.md` §4) — is **superseded** by the answer, never
completed or re-decided in place by this round: a `[V]` answered *decided* produces a new `[VD#n]`,
which *The will-change rule* phase tests like any other, and the *Write the register and the round
record* phase moves the record the line names to `superseded` with its closing
`Superseded <YYYYMMDD>: by [VD#m]` paragraph (`decision-register-format.md` §4); a `[C]` is held
for the customer, and `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s *Freeze the customer decisions* phase
supersedes the `[CD#n]` the line names. **One reading `withdrawn` or
`superseded` — terminal (§3), which a sweep or a reconciliation may have written while its question
waited — does not move**, and gains no paragraph. For a `[V]`, the answer still mints a new
`[VD#n]` here, and this run names both, the new record and the terminal one, under what still needs
a human, since the question was put against a record that no longer stands. For a `[C]`,
`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` follows a `superseded` record to its live successor and acts on
that one as though the line named it, and freezes nothing from an answer whose record, or live
successor, reads `withdrawn`: the operator records the answer for a human or rejects it, and either
way the entry is closed *answered by the customer*, naming the withdrawal
(its *Confirm every candidate* phase and its *Freeze the customer
decisions* phase, steps 1 and 3). A question put again and *deferred* keeps its round open, and the
record stands as it is until the question is answered. **No other source raises a question on a
successor this source has read** — a successor of a finding in the `evidence` of any held record,
waiting or put again, or of any plain record any `evidence` finding of which reads `SUPERSEDED`,
put again or confirmed — **whatever that successor's verdict and horizon**: which question such a
successor raises, if any, is this source's to say — the record's own, put again; none while a held
record waits on its prerequisite; none where a plain record's successors confirm it. The *Round 1 is
generated from the grounding* bullets therefore pass such a successor over, the `will-change` one
included, so the decision a question put again carries is never asked about twice.

**A decision reopened elsewhere is put again.** A `[VD#n]` or `[CD#n]` can read `reopened` with no
question putting it. Three runs write `reopened`, and each can leave one:
- `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s *Freeze the customer decisions* step 3, where a customer's
  answer contradicts or constrains a `decided` record of this BRD without replacing it;
- the propagation sweep of another BRD's `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`, which reopens a record
  of this BRD's register when a decision of that BRD it rests on moves
  (`decision-register-format.md` §5);
- a run of this command that wrote a reopen in its register write and stopped before writing the
  round record that held the question putting it (*A decision the re-grounding moved*, above). The
  reopen stands (`decision-register-format.md` §8), and the question, which no counted record ever
  held, is lost with the run.

Only an answer to a question that puts such a record again re-decides it
(`decision-register-format.md` §4). So this source takes **every `[VD#n]` and `[CD#n]` reading
`status: reopened` that is not in flight**, whichever run reopened it.

**A record is in flight** exactly where a question in a round record on file carries a
`- **Re-puts:**` line naming it and that question has no terminal disposition. For a `[C]`, the
line on its held entry in `interview/customer-questions.md` counts as well, where that entry is not
a torn write (`decision-register-format.md` §8): a round record written before its questions carried
the line recorded it on the entry alone. The question's state is the last one recorded at its
address (*Resolve the round*). A question that puts a record again reaches two of the five terminal
dispositions, and either ends the flight: *decided*, for a `[V]`, and *answered by the customer*,
for a `[C]`. It reaches none of the other three: its tag never moves, so it is never *re-tagged* or
*split*, and it is never a `[G]`, so it is never *answered from findings*. A *deferred* `[V]` and a
`[C]` *held for the customer* keep the record in flight. The test reads the line and nothing else.
`- **Re-puts:** none`, which every `[V]` that puts no record again carries (*Write the register and
the round record*), names no record and never counts. A `[V]` written by a released version before
the line existed names its record in prose only, so it holds no record in flight until *Put each
`[V]` to the operator*'s tie picker gives it the line, the first time a run resumes its round. Where
every round is closed, no question lacks a terminal disposition and so no record is in flight — and
every path that runs this source finds every round closed, the `--round <highest + 1>` request
included (*Resolve the round* stops it beside an open round). So no current path finds a record in
flight: the test is a guard, kept so that a path added later that runs a source beside an open round
cannot put one decision twice.

**Such a record makes a new round askable** (*Resolve the round*, the *Every round is closed*
bullet), and **it is raised in the round this run opens**, one question per record, round 1
included where a register is on file before any round. It is never raised in a round this run
resumes or re-opens, whose question set is settled. **A record reopened while a round is open
waits**: where this run works an open round instead, it is reported as waiting on that round, as a
changed finding is, and raised in the next round opened. The question:

- **carries the record's own tag** — `[V]` for a `[VD#n]`, `[C]` for a `[CD#n]` — and arrives at
  *Tag every question* carrying it, which that phase records rather than re-derives. The tag never
  moves, for the reason *A decision the re-grounding moved* gives;
- **restates the question the record answered**, from its `statement` and `options_considered`,
  and **is put against the current findings**: every finding of its `evidence` that does not read
  `SUPERSEDED`, as it stands, and every successor of one that does (*A superseded finding's
  successors*, above), each with its verdict and horizon. For a `[C]` those are its
  `- **Findings:**` line;
- **quotes every `Reopened <YYYYMMDD>:` paragraph on the record** as context, with what the record
  chose, so whoever answers sees what was decided, what reopened it, and why it is asked again;
- **carries the `- **Re-puts:**` line naming the record**, as every question putting a record again
  does (above), and a `[C]` carries no `- **Requirement defect:**` line, for the reason given above
  for a reopened record.

**The answer re-decides the record in place**, as the answer to a reopened record's question
always does (*What the answer does*, above). This source takes a record on its `status` and the
in-flight test alone: its findings are the question's context, never a test. So a reopened record whose evidence a
re-grounding has also moved is this source's alone, since *A decision the re-grounding moved* takes
only `open` and `decided` records.

**A later round holds only what became askable after the previous round's questions were written.** A question
that could have been asked in round 1 and was not is not "moved" to round 2; it stays in round 1,
carrying a holding state, and the resumption in *Resolve the round* is what returns to it. This
matters for the record: a decision from round 1 was taken without anything round 2 discovered, and
saying so later requires the round number to still mean what it says (§5).

**A later round is generated from what changed after the last round was generated, by the same
sources, and before it is opened.** *Resolve the round*'s *Every round is closed* branch runs the scoping
above and this generation for round `<highest + 1>` to learn whether that round would hold anything,
and opens it only where it would — so, as for round 1, this phase then works that set and generates
nothing again. The generation takes: the *Round 1 is generated from the grounding* bullets, applied
to each finding added, or whose verdict or verifier outcome changed, since the last round was
generated, whenever the change happened — the last round's `generated against:` line is the
anchor, and a record carrying no such line is compared at the earliest commit on any ref holding it
as it stands on disk, both as *Resolve the round*'s
*Every round is closed* branch fixes; a round's record is re-written by every run that works it,
and a finding a `--rebaseline` pass changed while that round was still open predates both its last
write and its closure, which is why the line and not the write is the anchor — less every successor *A decision the re-grounding moved* reads (above), and less every
finding reading `SUPERSEDED`, which raises nothing; *A decision the re-grounding moved* itself, one
question per record it puts again; *A decision reopened elsewhere*, one question per record it puts
again; and each requirement defect the round-1 test in *Resolve the round* places in a new round. A finding that stood when the last round was generated and has not
changed since raises nothing again: its question, where it had one, is in the round that asked it.
**One question comes from no change**: a record `decision-register-format.md` §8 counts whose
`round` is `<highest + 1>` — a re-decision that a run which stopped before writing that round's
record left standing, §8 counting a record carrying a `Reopened` paragraph whatever round it names —
is a question of the round being generated. **It is generated already disposed**: tagged `[V]`,
the tag of the question a `[VD#n]` answers — the only re-decision a stopped run of this command
can leave standing is a `[VD#n]`'s, since `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` re-decides a `[CD#n]`
and this command only reopens one — and carrying the terminal disposition *decided* naming the record, the answer the
stopped run took, and the `- **Re-puts:**` line naming it, as every question putting a record again
carries. *Tag every question* records that tag as it arrives, and *Put each `[V]` to the
operator* never queues it, since its queue holds only questions without a terminal disposition, so
it is put to nobody. That disposition is what names the record (§8), and the question makes the
round askable on its own: without it the register would name a round no record holds, and
`/product-workflows:brd-package` would stop on it for good.

**A re-decision can also stand at a round on file**, where the stopped run was working a round it
resumed: that round's record exists and does not name it, and the `[V]` that put the record again —
the question whose `- **Re-puts:**` line names it, never one reading `none` — still carries the *deferred* holding state its
record last recorded. **That question is not put again.** Where the record its line names carries a
`Reopened` paragraph, reads any status but `reopened`, and carries a `round` equal to that
question's round — which only a re-decision answering that question writes (§4) — the run that
resumes the round records the question *decided* naming the record, the answer the stopped run
took, and *Put each `[V]` to the operator* never queues it. The next write of the round record
names the record, which is what counts it (§8). Where the record reads `reopened` again — another
command reopened it after that re-decision — the question is put as ever, and its answer re-decides
the record once more. A re-put `[V]` whose answer superseded the record — a held one, or one a
propagation sweep reverted — needs no such rule: the stopped run's answer to it is a new `[VD#n]`,
a torn write the *Write the register and the round record* phase removes, with the `Superseded`
paragraph it wrote on that record (§8), so the question is put again against the record as it
stood.

**Questions carry no minted identifier.** The workflow's identifier namespaces are fixed (D21) and
none of them denotes a question, so nothing here invents a `[Q#n]`-style prefix. A question is
addressed by its round and its position in that round's record — questions are numbered in the order
they were written and **never renumbered**, and a split question keeps its number while its parts are
lettered beneath it (`5a`, `5b`, `5c`). **A re-tagged question keeps its number too**, for the same
reason a split one does: the record is append-only and the original is terminally disposed
*re-tagged* at that number, so the re-tagged question is the same question under a new tag and takes
**no new position**. What that buys is one address for a question's whole life — round and position
is how a question is addressed at all (above), and what `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` freezes
a `[CD#n]` against — where a re-numbered question would answer to one address before the re-tag and
another after it, with nothing on file saying they are the same question. **Two recorded states then
sit at that one address, and the last one governs.** The record is append-only, so the *re-tagged*
disposition stays where it was written and every later state for that question is appended beneath
it; every reader that asks what state a question is in — the resume rule in *Resolve the round*, the
closure rule in *Write the register and the round record*, `/product-workflows:brd-package`'s
gate on the rounds, and `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s closing of a round its answers settle —
takes the **last** state recorded at the address, and the earlier ones are
history, exactly as an earlier `Status:` line is (*Write the register and the round record*). A
question re-tagged and then *deferred* is deferred: its round
stays open and the resume rule returns to it. A question re-tagged and then *decided* carries a
terminal disposition and is not returned to. Taking the first state instead reads *re-tagged* as
this question's answer and closes a round around a question still in a holding state — the failure
the terminal/holding distinction exists to prevent. Where the re-tag
follows a split, the part keeps its letter as well (`5b` stays `5b`). Its durable handle, once it
produces one, is the `[VD#n]`, `[CD#n]` or `[AS#n]` it becomes.

---

## Phase 4 — Tag every question, before anything is asked

**Tag the entire round's set. Nothing below this line asks anybody anything until this phase has
finished.**

Apply the test in `interview-tagging.md` §2 — *what kind of thing would settle it* — to each
question in turn, and record the tag on the question in the held round record, which the *Write the
register and the round record* phase writes. Three outcomes, and only three:

- **Exactly one tag** → the question is ready. It joins that tag's set.
- **More than one tag** → **a defect in the question, not a gap in the taxonomy** (§4). Split it
  until each part carries exactly one tag, record the original's disposition as *split* naming the
  parts it became (§5), and put the parts through this same phase. The worked split is in §4 and is
  not reproduced here. Note the ordering that section fixes: the `[G]` part is answered first,
  because its answer routinely changes what the `[C]` part should ask.
- **No tag anybody can defend** → the question is **under-specified, not untaggable** (§4). Rewrite
  it until the test has something to bite on. It is not filed with a guessed tag in the meantime,
  and it is not asked while it carries one: guessing a tag to unblock a round is precisely how a
  `[V]` reaches a customer.

**A question putting a decision again arrives with its tag, and this phase records that tag rather
than re-deriving it** (*A decision the re-grounding moved* and *A decision reopened elsewhere*, in
*Generate the round's question set*):
it is the question the record answered, put again against moved ground, so it takes the first
outcome above with the tag that record's prefix names, and a finding that now seems to settle it is
context for whoever answers, never a reason to route it to `[G]`. Nor is it split or re-tagged here
or later: its tag never moves, which is what keeps its answer one the record can take. **The same
holds for the standing re-decision that section records**, which arrives tagged `[V]` and already
disposed *decided* — generated so, or recorded so as its round is resumed: this phase records the
tag, and the disposition it arrived with stands.

**The invariant this phase exists to establish**, and which every later phase depends on: when this
phase ends, every question in the round carries exactly one tag, and the three sets — `[G]`, `[V]`,
`[C]` — are fixed for this round. A question that could not be resolved into one of the three is
left in the round in the *untagged* holding state, with what is wrong with it recorded, and the
round stays open. It is never asked in that state, of anybody.

A question re-tagged later (the *Answer every `[G]` from the findings* phase) re-enters **here**, is
re-tested against §2, and joins whichever set it now belongs to. It never enters an asking phase by
any other route.

---

## Phase 5 — Answer every `[G]` from the findings

**This phase raises no prompt, and writes no file.** It reads findings and holds answers for the
round record, and it runs to completion before any operator queue opens.

For each `[G]` in the round, search the verified findings for one whose `claim` settles it. Only a
finding carrying a verifier `outcome` counts (the *Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD* phase
already refused the run if any lacked one). Three outcomes:

1. **A finding settles it.** Record the answer in the held round record, quoting the finding's verdict
   and naming every `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` it rests on, and mark the question **terminally disposed** as
   *answered from findings*. The finding ids recorded here are what a decision drawing on this answer later
   puts in its own `evidence` list.
2. **A finding exists and cannot settle it** — its verdict is `NOT-PROVABLE`, or the verifier
   returned `unprovable`. This is a complete and legitimate terminal answer, not a shortfall
   (`workflows-core:grounding-format` §3). **This route exists for the question the tagger could not
   have tagged any other way**: one raised against no finding, or against a different one, and
   tagged `[G]` because on what the tagger held it looked answerable from grounding — the
   `NOT-PROVABLE` finding turning up only here, when the findings are read against it. A question
   the *Round 1 is generated from the grounding* source raised **from** such a finding never reaches
   this phase: it carried that finding into tagging and was tagged for a person there. The question
   is then **re-tagged**, usually to `[V]`, and the re-tag
   **names that finding as its cause** (`interview-tagging.md` §3). Re-tagging to `[C]` is the
   exception and is correct only when what the repository could not settle turns out to have been a
   business question mistaken for a technical one — "the code does not tell us" is never on its own a
   reason to ask the customer. The original question is terminally disposed as *re-tagged*, naming
   the finding, and the re-tagged question goes back to the *Tag every question* phase to earn a
   terminal disposition of its own.
3. **No finding bears on it at all.** Then grounding has not been asked this question yet, and **the
   answer is a grounding pass, not a person.** Record the **holding state** *needs grounding* in the
   held round record, which
   is not a disposition and so keeps the round open, and name it in the final report with the concrete fix — a
   `/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY>` run (with `--rebaseline` when the repository has moved since
   the pin) to produce the finding, after which this round resumes at exactly this question. **It is
   not re-tagged**: a re-tag needs a finding to name, and there is none, so promoting it to `[V]`
   here would manufacture the missing trail rather than record its absence. And it is not asked: this
   command writes no findings — only `/prd-ground` does, and only through the independent
   re-derivation `workflows-core:grounding-format` §8 requires — so there is no route by which this run could
   turn its own guess into evidence.

---

## Phase 6 — Put each `[V]` to the operator

The queue is the `[V]` set the *Tag every question* phase fixed, plus anything the previous phase
re-tagged into it and which passed back through tagging. Nothing else, and nothing added after this
phase begins. **A `[V]` already disposed is in that set and not in the queue**: the standing
re-decision *A later round is generated from what changed* records carries its terminal disposition
from generation, or, in a round this run resumes, from the resume, and a question that already has
one is never asked.

**First, tie each resumed `[V]` that carries no `- **Re-puts:**` line to the record it puts again,
or to none — by asking, never by reading its prose.** Every write of this version that records a
`[V]` tag at a question's address carries the line, reading `none` where the question puts no
record again — its first write, and the write recording a re-tag or a rewrite into `[V]` alike
(*Write the register and the round record*) — so a question whose `[V]` tag is **on file** with no
line is exactly one a released version wrote before the line existed. That version
wrote a re-put `[V]` with its record named in prose alone, and every reader of a re-put keys on the
line: this phase's re-decision rule, the supersession *Write the register and the round record*
writes, the resume rule for a standing re-decision and the in-flight test (*Generate the
round's question set*). Nothing on file tells such a question's re-put from an ordinary one, so the
test is the known set, never the text, and **a `[V]` carrying the line — `none` included — is never
put to this picker**. **Nor is a question this run tags `[V]`** — by a re-tag in *Answer every
`[G]` from the findings*, or by rewriting an *untagged* one — since its `[V]` tag is not on file
yet and this run's write of the round record gives it the line. For each `[V]` in a round this run
resumes whose `[V]` tag the round record on file already records, that has no terminal disposition
and carries no `- **Re-puts:**` line, build the **candidate set**: every
`[VD#n]` reading `reopened`, every held `[VD#n]` *A decision the re-grounding moved* would put
again now, every `[VD#n]` reading `open` or `decided` whose `argumentation` carries a `Reverted`
paragraph after its last `Reopened` one — a reopened record a propagation sweep reverted, whose
question may still be waiting — and every `[VD#n]` carrying a `Reopened` paragraph whose `round` is the question's round
— a re-decision a stopped run took in answer to it, which the resume rule then records — less every
record another question's line holds in flight, and less every record this run's picker has
already tied to another question, so one record is never tied to two. **An empty candidate set asks
nothing**: the question is an ordinary `[V]`, and *Write the register and the round record* gives it
`- **Re-puts:** none` like any other. Otherwise, before the queue opens, put one tie
picker per such question, quoting the question and listing every candidate in prose above the
prompt — its id, `status` and `statement`:

```
choices: ["It puts again <candidate id> — <its statement>", "It puts again <next candidate id> — <its statement>", "None — it is an ordinary question and puts no record again"]
```

One entry per candidate, **up to three**, and the `None` entry last, always; where one candidate
exists the array is two entries. **Past three candidates, the overflow rule applies**
(`workflows-core:next-phase-offer`): the prose lists every one, the array carries the three whose
`statement` is closest to the question's, and the harness's free-text option reaches the rest. A
free-text answer is normalised to one candidate's id or to `None`, and re-asked where it names
neither — never written through. The answer is held, and *Write the register and the round record*
appends it to the round record under that question, before its state: `- **Re-puts:** [VD#n]`, or
`- **Re-puts:** none`, so the question then carries the line and the picker never asks about it
again. A question tied to a record is then a re-put
`[V]` like any other: the resume rule for a standing re-decision (*A later round is generated from
what changed*) applies to it first, and this phase's re-decision rule, or the supersession, to its
answer. **This picker asks which record, never the question itself**, and the
queue below is unchanged by it.

Present each question **exactly one at a time, never batched**, via `AskUserQuestion`, quoting the
question, the findings that bear on it with their verdicts and horizons, and — when it got here by a
re-tag — the `NOT-PROVABLE` finding that caused the re-tag, so the operator can see that the
repository was consulted first and came back empty.

The options presented are that question's own `options_considered`
(`decision-register-format.md` §1), generated per question rather than drawn from a fixed list, with
one trailing entry for an option the operator supplies themselves and the two standing exits:

```
choices: ["<the strongest option considered>", "<the next strongest, where a second was weighed>", "Defer this question — record why it is not answerable yet"]
```

**The array is bounded at four and authors no escape of its own, like every other array in the plugin** (`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0): `AskUserQuestion` renders `maxItems: 4`, so an uncapped `one entry per option considered` prompt cannot be presented at all once three options were weighed — and this phase is required to present its array verbatim. **The entries are two options at most, plus the defer entry: three, never four.** The two option slots are **one entry each**, substituted from the options weighed — not two entries per option, which is the reading that would put a four-option question past the cap on its own — and where only one was weighed the second slot is dropped, leaving two entries. **List every option considered as prose above the prompt**, in the order they were weighed and with the argumentation each carries, and let the harness's own free-text option carry the rest — §0 forbids an array from authoring that escape, and an authored `Another option from the list above` both duplicated it and spent a slot. Where one option was weighed, its entry is the only one beside defer.

**There is no listed `Cancel` and no listed free-text entry.** The harness always supplies a free-text option, so both an abort and an option the operator names themselves are reachable without spending a slot on either; say what an aborted round costs where the round is introduced, not in an option.

This is **not** an escalation choice list, and it is not one of the arrays
`workflows-core:escalation-rules` owns: its options are the decision's own, the
same way `/brd-split`'s ledger walk draws its picker from `coverage-ledger-format.md` §3's
dispositions rather than from an escalation array. The harness's free-text option returns an option the
operator names; that option joins `options_considered` and may then be `chosen`, so the record still
shows what was actually on the table.

**Then take the argumentation, and refuse the record without it.** After a choice is made, prompt for
why, and do not write a `[VD#n]` until something is supplied that is not a restatement of the
`statement`, not "to be filled in later", and not the name of whoever decided it.
`argumentation` is mandatory (`decision-register-format.md` §2), and the test for sufficiency is that
section's: **adequate when a reader who was not in the room can say what would have to change for the
answer to change.** A reason that survives being read back a month later names the constraint, not
the preference.

**Then, on exactly one condition, offer to record a code defect.** Where this decision's `evidence`
list holds at least one finding whose `verdict` is `REWRITTEN`, `AMENDED` or `FALSE-FRIEND` — the
three verdicts that mean grounding established the code does something other than what was claimed
(`workflows-core:grounding-format` §3) — ask the operator whether the position turns on a defect in
the code, and where it does, take a `[CDF#n]` against
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-defect-log-format.md` §2 and put its id in this decision's
`defects` list. **The trigger is read off the record, never out of prose**: there is no phrase this
command matches, and none is wanted — the tree carries no corpus of real registers to measure a
candidate pattern against, which is the evidence this repository requires before a prose proxy ships.

```
choices: ["No — this position does not turn on a code defect (Recommended)", "Yes — record a defect and cite it here"]
```

**The offer is a convenience, not the gate.** An operator may raise a `[CDF#n]` at any point in this
phase without being asked, and a decision whose evidence holds only `CONFIRMED` findings gets no
offer and may still need one. What catches the residue is `agents/brd-package-reviewer.md`, which
raises a finding where an `argumentation` asserts a recorded defect that no `defects` field names.

**A `[CDF#n]` is customer-visible.** The log ships in the review package
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §1.1), so take `statement`, `intent` and any
`operator-judgment` reasoning to the same standard this phase already applies to `argumentation`, and
refuse an entry that does not meet it.

**A later round may re-disposition an entry already on file, and this is the only exit `open` and
`conditional` have.** Where an entry read in from `code-defect-log.md` still carries `open`, or
carries `conditional` on a `blocked_on` this round has settled, put its disposition to the operator
once, against the same five values
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-defect-log-format.md` §4 fixes for a first raise. Two things
bound it, and neither is a matter of taste. **What may move is `disposition`, and `blocked_on` with
it** — added when the new disposition is `conditional`, dropped when it is not (§2). **What may not
move is `id`, `statement`, `behaviour`, `intent` and `intent_basis`**: those record what was true of
the pinned commit the cited `[CG#n]` names, and rewriting them would make the log report that an
earlier round found something it did not. `round` does not move either — §2 defines it as the round
that **raised** the defect, not the round that last touched it, and the re-disposition is reported in
this run's round record instead.

**This is one of the three carve-outs from the standing rule that a previous run's records are inputs,
never scratch** (*Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD*, step 9, which states the rule and names
all three — the others being a decision reopened under `decision-register-format.md` §4 and the
re-decision that follows it, and a `[VD#n]` reading `open` or `decided` — held by the will-change
rule, or reopened and then reverted by a propagation sweep — superseded by the answer to the
question that put it again). Rule and carve-out are not in tension: a re-disposition writes a
`disposition`, and the `blocked_on` that goes with it, on one record, and deletes, renumbers and
rewrites nothing. **There is still no `fixed` disposition** — nothing on
this route builds anything and no command here can observe a repair, so a defect that was fixed
keeps whatever disposition it had (§4).

Record each answered question as **terminally disposed** *decided*, with a `[VD#n]` held for the
register phase, carrying every field `decision-register-format.md` §1 defines — including `evidence`
(the findings this position rests on, written `evidence: []` where it rests on none, never omitted —
§1), `options_considered` (`["yes", "no"]` for a question put as yes or no — §1), `altitude`,
`round` (this run's), `consumed_by: none`, and `conditional_on` **written now by whoever takes the
decision, never reconstructed later** (§5), when the position is correct only while a named decision
of a named prerequisite BRD holds — for instance `conditional_on: EPIC-008/[VD#3]`, naming one
specific decision in that BRD's register and never the BRD as a whole. Which prefix a decision gets
is fixed by the tag of the question it answers, never by who typed it (§1): a question tagged `[V]`
produces a `[VD#n]`, and it does not become a `[CD#n]` because the customer later nods at it.

**That list is for a decision first recorded here, and a re-decision is not one.** Where the answer
re-decides a record already on file — reopened under `decision-register-format.md` §4, by this run
or an earlier one, or by another command — it mints no id and does not take every field §1 defines: it keeps that record's
`id`, `altitude` and `settles`, writes each of its fields under the rule **§4** gives that field
(its `round` becoming this run's and its `consumed_by` returning to `none`, both by that section
rather than by the list above), and has its argumentation appended after the `Reopened` paragraph
rather than written over it. §4 is the authority for all of it, and the *Write the register and the
round record* phase executes the write. **A decision's `round` moving is not the `[CDF#n]` rule
above read across**: a defect's `round` is the round that *raised* it
(`code-defect-log-format.md` §2) and never moves,
while a decision's is the round that produced the position on record, so a re-decision carries it
forward. Two records, two fields of the same name, two authorities.

**A question putting again a `[VD#n]` the will-change rule held is not a re-decision either**, and
takes the list above: its answer mints a new `[VD#n]` against the current findings, and the held
record, where it reads `open` or `decided`, is moved to `superseded`, with the closing
`Superseded <YYYYMMDD>: by [VD#m]` paragraph naming it, by the *Write the register and the round
record* phase — never re-decided in place, since it was never reopened under §4 and one of the two
it may be, `open`, is not a status §4 reopens. Where another run has meanwhile left it `withdrawn` or
`superseded`, it does not move, and the run names it with the new record under what still needs a
human (*A decision the re-grounding moved*). **Nor is one putting again a reopened `[VD#n]` that a
propagation sweep's *Reverted* returned to `open` or `decided` while its question waited**: a
reversion writes `status` afresh with the rest of the position it restores
(`decision-register-format.md` §4), so the record no longer reads `reopened`, and nothing on it
awaits a re-decision. It takes the list above exactly as a held one does — a new `[VD#n]`, and the
record moved to `superseded` with that paragraph by the same phase. **One putting again a `[VD#n]`
that reads `reopened` when the answer is taken, or that this run reopens in the same register write, is a re-decision**,
and takes the paragraph above — a plain record this run or an earlier one reopened, a held one a
propagation sweep reopened meanwhile (*A decision the re-grounding moved*, in *Generate the round's
question set*), or one *A decision reopened elsewhere* put again. **Which record a question puts
again is read off its `- **Re-puts:**` line** — or, for a question the tie picker above tied in
this run, off that held answer, which this run's round record writes as the line — and never off
its context, which names the earlier answer too; its status is read off that record. A `[V]` whose
line reads `none` puts no record again, and its answer is a decision first recorded here, taking the
list above. **One that reads `withdrawn` or `superseded` when
the answer is taken** — a reopened record left terminal by another run while its question
waited — is neither, and
takes the list above as a held one another run left terminal does: its answer mints a new `[VD#n]`,
the terminal record does not move, and the run names both under what still needs a human.

**Deferring is a recorded holding state, not a disposition and not a skip.** It records the reason
the question is not answerable yet, keeps the round **open**, and never converts the question to
another tag on the way out. It does **not** move the question into a later round: the question stays
where it was raised (the *Generate the round's question set* phase fixes that), and the resume rule
in *Resolve the round* returns to it. A round whose remaining questions are all deferred is an open
round with work left, and is reported as one. **This is the defer entry of the picker above, and
only that one**: *The will-change rule* phase's *Defer it until the prerequisite ships* resolves a
question that was answered, records the wait on the `[VD#n]` rather than on the question, and keeps
no round open (that phase says so). **An abort — the harness's free-text option, since the array
lists no `Cancel` — stops the run** naming how many `[V]` questions remain, **and writes nothing
this run decided into the BRD folder** — the one earlier write a run can have made is *Resolve
inputs and gate the grounded BRD*'s completion of a move a counted round record already names, which
decides nothing and stays uncommitted in `code-defect-log.md` until a later run of this command
reaches its handoff, which stages it: a `[VD#n]` taken in this phase is held for the register phase, which writes
every deliverable of the round — `decisions.md`, `code-defect-log.md`,
`interview/customer-questions.md` and the round record — and an abort never reaches it. So no answer
this pass took survives it, the round record stays as the last write left it, and the next run
resumes at the first question that record shows without a terminal disposition — each `[V]` decided
this pass among them — and puts it again; or, for a round this run opened, which no record yet
holds, regenerates that round's questions afresh and opens it again where they are still there to
ask. Say so when the abort is taken: the answers given are lost with the run.

---

## Phase 7 — Hold every `[C]`

A `[C]` is a genuine business decision and reaches the customer **only via the review package**
(`interview-tagging.md` §1) — never through this command, never through a side channel, and never
through the operator standing in for them. This phase therefore asks nobody anything, **and it
writes nothing either**: it builds each entry and holds it for the *Write the register and the round
record* phase, which writes it into `<BRD-dir>/interview/customer-questions.md` with the rest of the
round's deliverables (`decision-register-format.md` §8). An entry held here and never written leaves
nothing behind; one written before a round record named it would ask the customer a question no
round recorded asking.

For each `[C]` in the round **that carries no entry yet** — every `[C]` of a round this run opened,
and in a round it resumes or re-opens, each question that became a `[C]` in this run, by a re-tag, a
split or the round-1 test; a `[C]` an earlier run held keeps the entry it has — build an entry
carrying:
the question as it will be put, every row it names that this slice does not claim cited as
`<PARENT-KEY> [BR#n]` (*A row this slice does not claim*, in *Generate the round's question set*) —
the entry ships in the package, and `/brd-package` resolves a bare `[BR#n]` against this slice's
inventory alone; **its round and position, as the entry's own heading and the delimiter between
entries, written exactly `## Round <N>, question <position>`** — `<position>` being the question's
place in that round's record, counting from 1. **That heading is the entry boundary**, and pinning
it is what lets a reader bound one entry: `/brd-package` renders each held question into part 7 and
`/brd-reconcile` finds the entry an answer belongs to, and an entry opening any other way is one
neither can tell from the text of the entry above it. Then: **the findings that bear on it, on a
line of its own labelled exactly `- **Findings:**`** — each `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` with its verdict, and
`- **Findings:** none` where none bears on it, the line never omitted — so the customer is asked
against what is known rather than in the abstract, and so the three readers that parse it read a
field instead of a paragraph: `/brd-package` counts the entries listing a finding to choose the
claim to verify first and renders the line into the customer prompt, and `/brd-reconcile` copies it
into the answering `[CD#n]`'s `evidence`, where a paragraph it cannot parse becomes an
`evidence: []` claiming the customer was shown nothing; **its altitude, on a line of
its own labelled exactly `- **Altitude:**`** — `product`, `architecture` or `implementation`,
decided by the mapping `decision-register-format.md` §1 gives a record's `altitude` from the
downstream artifact the answer must reach — the PRD, the ARD or the specification — because the
`[CD#n]` that answers the question copies it (`/brd-reconcile`, *Freeze the customer decisions*)
and a customer answer has no other source for it; **for a `rejected` row's question, that row, on a
line of its own labelled exactly `- **Rejected row:** [BR#n]`**, which is how a later run finds the
row's question rather than raising a second one (*One question per row*, in *Resolve the round*);
**for a question the requirement-defect source raised, a `rejected` row's question carrying the
defect it cites, or a re-put question carrying the defect its held record `settles`, the `[DEF#n]`
it asks about, on a line of its own labelled exactly `- **Requirement defect:** [DEF#n]`**,
carrying that id and nothing else; **for a question putting a `[CD#n]` again — one the will-change
rule held, one this run reopened on its successor findings, or one *A decision reopened elsewhere*
puts again — that record, on a line of its own labelled exactly `- **Re-puts:** [CD#n]`**, the same
line the question carries in the round record — the one line `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`
supersedes a held record, or re-decides a reopened one, from, since the entry's context names the
earlier answer too (*A decision the re-grounding moved*, in *Generate the round's question set*);
**and, where the defect
sits on a row drawn from an image, that image's path relative to `brd/`, on the next line, labelled
exactly `- **Defect image:** <path relative to brd/>`** — the form an image anchor names it by
(`brd-format.md` §2), which the bundle's manifest maps to the image's bundled filename, so the
customer can find the picture the question is about. The path never goes on the defect's line,
whose one value a reader copies. **The `- **Requirement defect:**` line is the one every reader of
the entry takes the defect from, and nothing else in the entry**, whose context may name other
`[DEF#n]`s: `/brd-reconcile` copies its id into the answering `[CD#n]`'s `settles` field, every
slice under the parent reads it to know the defect is **asked** (*Round 1 is generated from the
grounding*), and `/product-workflows:brd-package` renders it into the customer's copy of the
question; and, where a `[G]`
part of the same original question was answered first, that answer — because the business question
it leaves is materially different from the one that would have been asked without it (§4).

Each `[C]` is recorded in the round with the **holding state** *held for the customer*. **Holding a
question is not an answer to it**: the terminal disposition *answered by the customer* is reached
only when the answer comes back and an operator confirms it, so a round holding a `[C]` stays open
until `/brd-reconcile` closes it with the customer's answer, as the paragraph after next says.

**No `[CD#n]` is written here, and none may be.** A customer decision enters the register only when
the customer has actually answered and an operator has confirmed the answer (D14,
`decision-register-format.md` §1) — the customer answering and the register recording an answer are
two separate acts, and normalising prose into a decision is inference, not authority.

**This command sends the file nowhere; `/brd-package` is what carries it.** That command builds the
review package the `[C]` questions travel in, and it is a separate, consented run — writing the file
is not sending it. A `[C]` this run holds stays held until a package goes out and an answer
comes back, and the round that contains it stays open throughout (`interview-tagging.md` §5) until
`/brd-reconcile` ingests that answer and an operator confirms it — that command writes the terminal
disposition *answered by the customer*, and it is the only thing that closes such a round. Report
that as the plain sequence it is: this run holds, `/brd-package` carries, the customer answers, and
`/brd-reconcile` records.

---

## Phase 8 — The will-change rule

Before any `[VD#n]` this run took is written as `decided`, test its `evidence` list against
`decision-register-format.md` §6 (D19): **a decision may not rest solely on a `will-change`
finding.** The test fires when *every* finding in the list carries `horizon: will-change`
(`workflows-core:grounding-format` §5). It does **not** fire on a decision resting on one `current` finding and
two `will-change` ones — the `current` finding is ground that holds — nor on `evidence: []`, which
rests on no `will-change` finding either (§6).

Where it fires, the decision may not be closed. Offer the three resolutions §6 defines — exactly
three, drawn from that section's own table the way the `[V]` picker draws its options from §1:

```
choices: ["Re-base it on a current finding — the decision's evidence list changes", "Make it explicitly conditional on the prerequisite — conditional_on: <BRD-KEY>/<decision-id>", "Defer it until the prerequisite ships — status: open, with the blocking prerequisite named", "Cancel"]
```

Record the outcome as that table prescribes: a changed `evidence` list, a `conditional_on` naming one
specific decision of the prerequisite (`EPIC-008/[VD#3]`, never `EPIC-008` alone — §5), or
`status: open` with the blocking prerequisite named.

**Whichever of the three is taken, the question stays *decided*, naming the `[VD#n]`, and its round
can close.** The operator answered it, with argumentation; what the rule holds back is the record,
not the question. So *Defer it until the prerequisite ships* is **not** the *deferred* holding state
of the *Put each `[V]` to the operator* phase: that state records a question nobody could answer yet,
and keeps its round open so the resume rule returns to it, while this one records an answer whose
ground is about to move — and a resume that returned to it would put the same question against the
same findings, which fires this same test again. The record, `open` or `conditional_on` its
prerequisite, is the thing that waits. Its exit is the question a later round puts again once a
`--rebaseline` pass has superseded every `will-change` finding it rests on and no successor of them
is still `will-change` — the prerequisite having shipped (*A decision the re-grounding moved*, in
*Generate the round's question set*) — proposed in the ordinary way once every round is closed,
which a round held open around this question would have prevented for good. A record written
`conditional_on` has a second exit besides: `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`'s propagation sweep,
which reaches it by that field when the prerequisite's decision moves
(`decision-register-format.md` §5); that sweep's citation pass also reaches a held record of either
kind that names an id its reconciliation changed.

**This picker's vocabulary is closed, and holding it closed is required here rather than merely
permitted.** `workflows-core:escalation-rules` names this picker among the arrays
whose free-text answer is normalised into their own vocabulary rather than written through — the
harness supplies that option on every array and no picker can decline it, so the discipline is in
what the run does with the answer, not in the array's shape. The rule being applied admits
**exactly three** resolutions and says so — "Three resolutions, and exactly three"
(`decision-register-format.md` §6). An open-ended fourth entry would invite a resolution the rule
does not have, and the two most likely things an operator would write into it are precisely the two
evasions §6 and §7 already refuse (below). `Cancel` remains, so nobody is trapped — and it is not
a fourth resolution, nor the third under another name: it stops the run before *Write the register
and the round record*, which writes every deliverable of the round, so **`Cancel` writes nothing
this run decided into the BRD folder** — beyond, at most, *Resolve inputs and gate the grounded
BRD*'s completion of a move a counted round record already names, left uncommitted until a later run
reaches its handoff — not this `[VD#n]` in any status, not any other this pass took, not a `[C]`
entry *Hold every `[C]`* built, and not a defect line *One question per row* decided to add. The
question keeps whatever state the round record last recorded, and the next run puts it again — or,
for a round this run opened, which no record yet holds, regenerates that round's questions afresh
and opens it again where they are still there to ask. Say all of it when `Cancel` is taken.

**Two things this picker deliberately does not offer.** It does not offer to **remove** the
`will-change` finding from the `evidence` list: a decision whose evidence was thinned until the rule
stopped firing rests on exactly what it rested on before, minus the record of it (§6). And it does
not offer to **re-file the position as an `[AS#n]`**: an assumption is a record with no findings
behind it at all, and calling a position with findings an assumption to escape this rule is the same
evidence-thinning under a different name (§7).

`[AS#n]` records are outside this phase entirely — §6 cannot fire on one, because the rule tests the
horizons of findings in an `evidence` list and an assumption's list holds none.

---

## Phase 9 — Write the register and the round record

**This phase is the one writer of a round's deliverables in this command, and it writes them in one
order**: `code-defect-log.md` where this round raises an entry, then `decisions.md`, then
`interview/customer-questions.md` where this round holds a `[C]` or adds a defect line, then
`interview/round-<N>.md` **last** — the log before the register, so a decision this round writes
never cites a `[CDF#n]` on no file (`decision-register-format.md` §8). Then, **fifth and only after
the round record names them**, each re-disposition the *Put each `[V]` to the operator* phase took
is applied to `code-defect-log.md`. Every phase before this one builds what it contributes and holds
it here — a `[VD#n]` or `[AS#n]`, a `[CDF#n]` or a re-disposition, a held entry, a defect line, a
`--round N` re-open, a question the round-1 test adds — so a run that stops before this phase, by a
`Cancel`, an abort or an interruption, writes nothing it decided into the BRD folder — the one
earlier write being *Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD*'s completion of a re-disposition a
counted round record already names, which decides nothing. **The round record is the
commit point** (`decision-register-format.md` §8): a round's deliverables count only once its record
names them, so an interruption between these writes leaves **torn writes**, which no reader
counts, beside the in-place changes §8 lets stand — a reopen, a re-decision — each true whether or
not the round record followed it. A re-disposition is not one of them: it waits for the record. Two writes of the same files are not this
phase's and are not a round's: `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` writes the register, the question
set and the round record by its own rules, and *Resolve the round*'s no-new-round path writes the
register's header line where none is on file, as a completed run.

**First, before any of the writes above, where the round record this run writes to already exists
and carries no `code defects:` line or no `requirement defects:` line, append the baseline line §8
fixes for each it lacks** — `code defects on file:` naming every `[CDF#n]` of the round on file at
this run's start, and `requirement defects on file:` naming every `[DEF#n]` a defect line on the
round's entries carried then, none of them a torn write, each reading `none` where the set is empty.
A record written before those lines existed is read as naming every item of its kind in its round
(§8); the baseline pins that reading to what was there, so no item this run adds is counted before
a later line names it. It names nothing new, and it is not an account line: *Resolve the round*'s
round-1 test reads `requirement defects:` alone.

**Then, in the write of each file that holds a torn write — one of the writes above, made for the
removal alone where this round writes nothing else to that file — remove them before appending this
run's own** — every torn write in this BRD's folder, the ones the *Resolve inputs and gate the
grounded BRD* phase reported: a torn record from `decisions.md`, a torn `[CDF#n]` from
`code-defect-log.md`, a torn entry or a torn defect line from `interview/customer-questions.md`;
and, where a torn `[VD#m]` superseded a record, that record's `Superseded <YYYYMMDD>: by [VD#m]`
paragraph with it, its `status` restored as §8 says. It is the one deletion this command makes in a
deliverable — the no-new-round path, which skips this phase, makes the same one — and it deletes
nothing any reader counted. So where this run regenerates a round an interrupted run opened, that
round's entries are written afresh at the headings this run's positions give them, whatever
positions the interrupted run gave its own.

**`<BRD-dir>/decisions.md`** — one block per `[VD#n]` and per `[AS#n]`. A block this run records for
the first time carries every field `decision-register-format.md` §1 defines on a `[VD#n]`, and on
an `[AS#n]` every one of them §7 admits and none it marks *not applicable*, which §1.1 omits rather
than writes empty — §7 accounts for all thirteen, saying of each whether it is as-is, means
something different, or does not apply; a block that **re-decides** a record
already on file takes each field under the rule §4 gives it instead, which is the paragraph below
and not this list.
Ids are contiguous within their own prefix, assigned once, **never renumbered and
never reused after a terminal status** (§1) — a re-run continues the sequence from the highest id on
file and never restarts it. A run that reopens a decision writes `status: reopened` with its cause
named in the closing `Reopened <YYYYMMDD>:` paragraph §4 appends to its `argumentation`, against the
original record's id; it never mints a new id for the same question, unless another run has
meanwhile left that record terminal, when the answer mints a new `[VD#n]` and the terminal record is
not written, or a propagation sweep has meanwhile reverted it, when the answer mints a new `[VD#n]`
that supersedes it (both below). That, and the re-decision
following it — in this run or a later one — which writes the record's fields under §4's per-field
rules and its argumentation after that paragraph, is the second of the three exceptions the *Resolve
inputs and gate the grounded BRD* phase admits to rewriting another run's record. **The reopen
this phase writes includes the one *A decision the re-grounding moved* (in *Generate the round's
question set*) takes on a plain `[VD#n]` or `[CD#n]` in the run that puts its question**, its
`Reopened` paragraph naming the successor findings as that section fixes; on a `[CD#n]` the status
and that paragraph are all this command writes, the customer's `chosen` and quoted reason standing
untouched until `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` re-decides it from the customer's answer. **The
third is the superseded record's, and it mints a new id for a question already answered**: a `[V]`
putting again a `[VD#n]` that reads `open` or `decided` when its answer is written — one the
will-change rule held, or a reopened one whose `reopened` a propagation sweep's *Reverted* undid
while the question waited — is answered by a new `[VD#n]`, and that record — the one the
question's `- **Re-puts:**` line names, or the tie picker's held answer names where this write
gives the question its line — has its `status` moved to `superseded` and its `argumentation` given
the closing `Superseded <YYYYMMDD>: by [VD#m]` paragraph `decision-register-format.md` §4 fixes,
naming the new id — nothing else on it moves. Neither kind reads `reopened`, so there is no
re-decision to write onto it: a held one was never reopened, and one `open` under §6 is not a status
§4 reopens at all; a reverted one's reopen was undone with the rest of its position. **A re-put `[VD#n]` another run has meanwhile left `withdrawn` or
`superseded` — a held one, or a reopened one — is answered by a new `[VD#n]`
too, and is not written**: its status is terminal (§3), and the new `[VD#n]` is written beside it,
both named under what still needs a human in the final report (*A decision the re-grounding
moved*) — a mint with no rewrite, and so no exception.

**The register is written on every run that reaches this phase, whether or not the round produced a
record.** Where no register is on file, this run creates it, and its first line is the header —
`# Decision register: <BRD-KEY>`, this BRD's key (§1) — whether or not the round recorded anything.
Where the round recorded no `[VD#n]` or `[AS#n]` — a round of nothing but `[C]` questions and
questions answered from findings, or one that raised no question — that line is the whole file.
Without the file, `/product-workflows:brd-package` Phase 0 step 6 stops with
`BRD_PACKAGE_NEEDS_INTERVIEW` as though no interview had written one, and a further run of this
command would resume the same round and again record nothing — a loop. A register already on file is
never rewritten to its header: this run's records are added after those on file.

Every `[AS#n]` this round recorded carries the two fields §7 gives a different meaning: `evidence`
holding the explicit statement of **why no evidence exists** — what was searched and why it fell
short — and `argumentation` saying **why the package proceeds on the assumption rather than stopping
to establish it**. A bare sentence with no account of its own groundlessness is a claim, not an
assumption record.

**`<BRD-dir>/interview/round-<N>.md`** — the round's own record, append-only. **A round that raised
no question at all records the walk instead of the questions**: each of the seven sources *Round 1
is generated from the grounding* names, and what this BRD held under each — **written from what the
walk found, never from a rule over verdicts**: no finding whose verdict left its premise open (the
first two sources: a premise that moved, and one the repository could not settle), none carrying a
`will-change` horizon, no design divergence, no `rejected` row not already settled and no
`deferred-to` row whose consequence is unstated, no open requirement defect this BRD asks, nothing
asserted without evidence — and, where a register was on file before the round, that *A decision
reopened elsewhere* found no record to put again. Naming the verdicts instead would put a false sentence in the record on
any corpus holding a `SUPERSEDED` finding, which raises no question and is not `CONFIRMED` either.
That is a complete record of a completed walk, which is exactly what the all-delegated stop's
prohibition on an *empty* record is protecting against. Otherwise: every question in the order it
was written, its tag, **on every question that puts an existing record again, that record on a
line of its own labelled exactly `- **Re-puts:** [VD#n]` or `- **Re-puts:** [CD#n]`**, whatever the
question's tag, **and on every other `[V]` the same line reading `- **Re-puts:** none`**, written
by the write that first records its `[V]` tag (below), every re-tag with the finding that caused it, every split with the parts it
became, and each question's state **as the record last records it** — a re-tagged question carrying
two states at one address, the *re-tagged* disposition and whatever the question then reached, of
which the last governs (*Questions carry no minted identifier*, in *Generate the round's question
set*) — in the vocabulary the *Resolve the round* phase fixes: either a
**terminal disposition** (*answered from findings*, *decided* naming the `[VD#n]`, *answered by the
customer*, *re-tagged* naming its cause, or *split* naming its parts) or a **holding state** (*held
for the customer*, *deferred*, *needs grounding*, or *untagged*) — **all four**, exactly as the
*Resolve the round* table names them, because a file schema that lists three is a schema under which
the fourth cannot be written down. Plus, when this run re-opened the round, the re-open and its
cause. This file is what makes the round resumable: resumability is a property of the record, not of
the session (`interview-tagging.md` §5), and an interrupted run resumes at the first question here
carrying no terminal disposition — the same test, in the same words, that *Resolve the round*
resumes on.

**The `- **Re-puts:**` line naming a record goes on every question that puts an existing record
again, and on no other; and every `[V]` carries the line, reading `none` where it names no
record.** A `[C]` that puts no record again carries no line: its reader,
`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`, acts only on one that names a record. The re-puts are the questions *A decision the re-grounding moved* puts for a held record or a
plain one it reopens, the questions *A decision reopened elsewhere* puts, and the standing
re-decision *A later round is generated from what changed* records. A question that only names an
earlier record as context names none — a requirement defect asked anew, which names the earlier
`[CD#n]` its row's answer froze (*One question per row*, in *Resolve the round*), among them —
because the line is what re-decides or supersedes the record it names. Every reader that ties such
a question to its record reads the line and parses nothing else: *Put each `[V]` to the operator*'s
re-decision rule, *Write the register and the round record*'s supersession of the record it names, the
resume rule for a standing re-decision, the in-flight test of *A decision reopened elsewhere*, and,
from the `[C]` entry's copy of the line, `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile`. **`none` names no
record**, so every one of those readers reads a `[V]` carrying it as an ordinary question: it puts
nothing in flight, is re-decided and supersedes nothing, and takes no standing re-decision. **The
line is written by the write that first records a `[V]` tag at the question's address, and never
moves after it**, the record being append-only. That is the question's first write where it is
written `[V]` — a re-put, a standing re-decision, or any other question tagged `[V]` as it is
generated, added or split off — and otherwise the later write recording it `[V]`: a re-tag from `[G]` (*Answer
every `[G]` from the findings*), or a rewrite out of *untagged* (*Tag every question*), whose line
is appended under that state and reads `none`. A question that puts a record again is never
re-tagged, since its tag never moves, so a line written at a re-tag or a rewrite always reads
`none`. **Save one late write**: a `[V]` whose `[V]` tag a released version wrote before the line
existed carries none, and gets it, appended under the question, from *Put each `[V]` to the
operator*'s tie picker, or reading `none` where that picker asks nothing (*Put each `[V]` to the
operator*). A question whose `[V]` tag is on file with no line is therefore exactly such a
question, and the picker's only subject.

**Every write of a round record ends with one `Status:` line, which records the round's state; the
dispositions decide it** — save the baseline append (above), which records no state and names
nothing new, and which this phase's own write of the record follows in the same run. The line reads
`Status: open — waiting on <each holding state a question in it is in>` or
`Status: closed <YYYYMMDD> — <why>`, dated the day of the write; which of the two is the closure
rule's to say (below), never a separate judgement. The record is append-only, so a write that
changes the round's state appends a new line and never edits the one before it: an earlier `Status:`
line is history, and a reader takes the last. **Where the last line and the dispositions disagree,
the dispositions win** — a line an interrupted write left behind, one a hand edit changed, or one a
run before 3.7.0 wrote in another sense never keeps a round open or closes one — and the next write
appends a line that agrees. **`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` is the one other writer**: it
appends `Status: closed <YYYYMMDD> — <why>` where its answers leave every question in the round with
a terminal disposition, and no line otherwise, the round being open and staying open. Where it
answered fewer than all of a round's questions, the last line it leaves may still name a holding
state no question is in any more — *held for the customer* after it answered the last held `[C]`,
with a *deferred* question still open beside it — and the dispositions win over it, as above; the
next `/brd-interview` write of the record appends a line that agrees. A record carrying no `Status:`
line at all is read off its questions' dispositions the same way, and the next write of it adds one.

**The first write of every round record carries one `generated against:` line, and no later write
adds or edits one.** It lists every finding on file under `grounding/` not reading `SUPERSEDED`
when the round's questions were generated, each with the verdict and verifier outcome it then
carried, or reads `none` where there was no such finding:

```
generated against: [CG#n]=<verdict>/<outcome>, [DG#n]=<verdict>/<outcome>, …
```

It is the anchor *Resolve the round*'s *Every round is closed* branch compares the grounding against
to learn what changed since this round was generated — so the round-1 record of a walk that raised
no question carries it as every other first write does — and it records the generation, never a
later run's view: a `--round N` re-open appends to a record that already has its line, or that
predates the line and keeps the fallback that branch names.

**Every round record this command writes carries one line accounting for the requirement-defect
source**, whether or not the round raised a question. It accounts for every open requirement defect
that joins a row of this BRD's in-scope set and that no slice had asked before this round — each of
a class grounding cannot settle, **and each defect of any class a rejected row of this BRD carries,
an `unsourced` one included**, since the carrier rule reads the defect a rejection cites whatever its
class (*Round 1 is generated from the grounding* fixes each test): this round either asked it or
withheld it, with the cause —

```
requirement defects: [DEF#n], … asked; [DEF#m] withheld — <cause>
```

— where `<cause>` is `not owned here` (another slice owns it — holds its lowest-numbered live row,
or, none being live, is its carrier — and asks it),
`no live row — <each row it joins and its disposition>` (no row it joins is live and no slice
carries it — each is `superseded-by`, never delegated, or rejected citing something else — so no
slice owns it and this route will not put it to the customer), `undecidable — <why>` (the
unallocated row, or the sibling whose ledger, question set or round record could not be read, named),
`belongs to round 1 — re-open named`, or `waits — round <open> still open` (a defect for a new round
that cannot open yet). Either half is left out where it is empty, and where there is no such defect
at all the line reads `requirement defects: none this BRD asks`. **Never
`none open in this BRD's scope`**: that is false wherever an in-scope row carries a defect a sibling
asks. *Resolve the round* reads this line on round 1's record and on no other round's — whether round 1's record carries it is
what tells a slice interviewed before this source existed from one interviewed after.

**Every write of a round record carries one line accounting for the code-defect log**, whether or
not the write touched it — save the baseline append, whose `code defects on file:` line names only
what was already there and which raised nothing:

```
code defects: raised [CDF#n], …; re-dispositioned [CDF#m] #k <old> → <new>, …
```

— either half left out where it is empty, and `code defects: none` where both are; a move to
`conditional` is written `re-dispositioned [CDF#m] #k <old> → conditional (blocked_on: <what would
settle it>)`, so the line alone carries everything the move writes. **`#k` numbers the moves of one
`[CDF#n]`**: `k` is one more than the number of numbered moves the counted round records of this
BRD already name for it — a known set, read at this run's start — so the order of a `[CDF#n]`'s
moves is carried by the files and never inferred from round numbers, which a `--round N` re-open
breaks (`decision-register-format.md` §8). It is where the round record
names each `[CDF#n]` this write raised, which is what keeps an entry of the log from reading as a
torn write (`decision-register-format.md` §8), and it is the **only** authority for a
re-disposition: the move is applied to the log after this record is written, and a run that stops
between the two is completed from this line by the next (*Resolve inputs and gate the grounded
BRD*, step 9).

**`<BRD-dir>/interview/customer-questions.md`** — every entry the *Hold every `[C]`* phase built,
appended after the entries on file, and every defect line *One question per row* decided to add,
appended to the held entry it joins. Written third, after the register and the log and before the
round record, so a question reaches the file only in the write that precedes the record naming it.
Where no `[C]` was held and no line added, the file is not written, save to remove a torn write.

**`<BRD-dir>/code-defect-log.md`** — every `[CDF#n]` this round raised, appended after any already on
file, each carrying every field `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-defect-log-format.md` §2
defines. Ids are contiguous, assigned once, never renumbered and never reused: a re-run continues the
sequence from the highest id on file. **The file is written where this round raised an entry or
re-dispositioned one already on file, or to remove a torn write, and is absent only where no run
raised one** — that absence is
an ordinary state that no later gate reads as a failure. Every entry's `behaviour` names a `[CG#n]`
that is on file in this BRD's own `grounding/code-grounding.md` and carries a verifier outcome; an
entry citing anything else is not written, because the packaging run will refuse the bundle over it
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/bundle-packaging.md` §6.2 relation 1).

**Plus every re-disposition the *Put each `[V]` to the operator* phase took on an entry already on
file — written fifth, after the round record names it** (`decision-register-format.md` §8), never
with the raises above: a run that stops before the record leaves the entry as it stood, and the
next run offers the re-disposition again. That entry is rewritten **in place, in its own position**, never appended as a second record
and never renumbered: `disposition` takes the new value, and `blocked_on` is added or dropped as that
value requires (§2). Every other field of it is written back byte for byte — `id`, `statement`,
`behaviour`, `intent`, `intent_basis` and `round` — so the log continues to say what the round that
raised the entry established. A re-disposition changes the entry count not at all, which is what
distinguishes it in the round record from a raise.

**Round closure is decided here, and only by the record.** The round closes when every question in
it carries a **terminal** disposition, and not before. **Any** of the four holding states keeps it
open — so a round is not closed because the interesting questions are answered, because the
remainder was *deferred*, because a `[G]` is *needs grounding* and waiting on a grounding pass,
because a question is still *untagged* and has not been rewritten yet, or because a `[C]` is *held
for the customer* whose turnaround is slow. Report the round as open or closed accordingly, and when
open, name which holding state it is waiting on — in the final report, and in the `Status:` line
that ends this write of the round record (above).

## Phase 10 — Handoff

Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff")` and **execute §4.3 in
full rather than its array alone**: run §2.1's push-target probe first, and where it sets
`remote: none` print §4.3's no-remote line immediately above the array, unreworded. Then present its
§4.3 choice array verbatim — the **gated — stopping** variant (§4.1 bullet 1), since `/brd-package`
stops on this run's `decisions.md` (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.4):

```
choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git (the next phase will stop until this is on main)", "Cancel"]
```

**The probe is named here because quoting the array is what invites skipping it.** A live run of
this phase read the instruction above, presented the array and ran no probe, offering a
`(Recommended)` push-and-open-PR on a specs repo with no `origin` and no notice — the state
`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §2.1 records that probe as having been added for. Carry the `remote`
value the probe set into `handoff-to-main` below, which §2.1 expects carried rather than probed a
second time.

On the first choice, execute `handoff-to-main` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args:
"phase-handoff handoff-to-main")`, §2) with `prefix: brd` (§2.9's table, where `brd` is the prefix
the `/brd-*` commands share), `feature_folder` as resolved in the *Resolve inputs and gate the
grounded BRD* phase, `deliverable_paths` = every file this run wrote or updated under `<BRD-dir>`
(`decisions.md`, `interview/round-<N>.md`, `interview/customer-questions.md` when this round held a
`[C]`, appended a defect line to a held entry already on file or removed a torn write from it, and
`code-defect-log.md` when this round raised a `[CDF#n]`, **re-dispositioned one already on file**,
removed a torn write from it or completed an earlier run's re-disposition in it — a run that only
re-dispositioned still wrote the file, and leaving it out of the set would hand off a round record
naming a disposition no ref carries — and also wherever
`git -C "$SPECS_PATH" status --porcelain -- <its path>` reports it changed, since an earlier run that completed a re-disposition in step 9 and
stopped before its own handoff left it so),
`title: <BRD-KEY> Record round <N> interview decisions`, and
`body_facts` = the round number and whether it opened, resumed or re-opened; the question counts by
tag; the `[G]` answers and the re-tags with their causes; the `[VD#n]`, `[AS#n]` and `[CDF#n]` ids
written and every `[CDF#n]` re-dispositioned, each with its old and new disposition, and every
re-disposition completed for an interrupted run; every torn write removed; the `[C]` count
held, and every defect line appended to a held entry; every will-change resolution taken; every
held record put again, with the record that superseded it where this round wrote one; every
reopened record a propagation sweep reverted whose re-put question this round answered, with the
record that superseded it; every plain
record reopened on its successor findings, with the question that puts it again; and every reopened
record *A decision reopened elsewhere* put again, with its question. Emit
its §4.1 outcome line in the final report.

The no-new-round path in *Resolve the round* — every round closed and nothing a question source would ask — reaches this
phase with nothing staged where the register was already on file, it removed no torn write,
*Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD* completed no re-disposition and `code-defect-log.md`
carries no change an earlier run left uncommitted, so it reports the `nothing
to commit` line rather than opening a pull request; otherwise it hands off what it wrote —
`decisions.md` where it wrote the register's header line, any file its torn-write removal changed,
and `code-defect-log.md` where step 9 completed a re-disposition in it or an earlier run left one
uncommitted. **The nothing-askable first run is not
that path and does stage**: it wrote `interview/round-1.md`, and `decisions.md` with it (the header
alone, where none was on file), and both are deliverables handed off with the rest.

---

## Phase 11 — Next steps

The BRD-to-PRD route's next command is `/brd-package`, which builds the review package the `[C]`
questions travel in, and it is offered **only where this run's own state says `/brd-package` would
accept the BRD** — the clause and the list must agree, or an operator is handed a run that stops on
its Phase 0 gate. `/brd-reconcile` is the command after that one and is not offered here: it ingests
a review that has not been asked for yet, and offering it now would name a step out of order. So the
honest offer is the state this run actually leaves behind.

**Compute the gate before printing the list, and compute every step of it.** `/brd-package` gates
on the register in its Phase 0 step 6 and on content in steps 7 and 8, and an offer that evaluates
some of them still hands the operator a run that stops on another. Apply each, **exactly as those
steps state them**, over the whole BRD's rounds and register rather than over this round alone,
because that is what `/brd-package` reads:

- `commands/brd-package.md` Phase 0 step 6 (*Gate the decision register on main*) — the register in
  the folder, and on the default branch. Its merge half is what the offer's `<merge-clause>` names;
  its presence half is established below, before either content gate.
- `commands/brd-package.md` Phase 0 step 7 (*Gate on the interview's rounds — and read the
  precondition the only way that is not a deadlock*) — which holding state it admits and which three
  it refuses is stated there.
- `commands/brd-package.md` Phase 0 step 8 (*Gate on there being something to review — and report it
  as a finished state, not a missing step*) — what a package must carry for a customer to have
  anything to confirm, correct or attack is stated there.

None of the three is restated here, deliberately: `/brd-package` is the command that actually
refuses the run, so a second copy of any of its preconditions sitting in this phase would drift, and
the run that reads the drifted copy is this one. The register present and both content gates pass →
`package_offerable: yes`. Step 7 fails →
`package_offerable: rounds-unsettled`, and every question that gate named is named beside the list
with its round and its holding state. **Before either gate is consulted: where this run's round-1
test (*Resolve the round*) reported requirement defects that belong to a closed round 1 →
`package_offerable: defects-unasked`, whatever the two gates would say.** The gates cannot see those
defects, because no round holds a question for them: a BRD holding nothing else passes step 7 and
fails step 8, and would be called decided while this run's own report names questions its customer
has never been asked; one holding an open `[AS#n]` passes both, and would be offered a package that
leaves those questions out and needs a second package to carry them. **Step 6's presence half, and
step 8's test for an `interview/` round record, need no value of their own: every path that reaches
this phase has left a register and a round record on file** — *Write the register and the round
record* writes both on every run that reaches that phase, and the no-new-round path writes the
register where none was and found every round already recorded — and every run that stops before
writing them, the all-delegated stop among them, never reaches this phase. So no offer made here
meets `/brd-package`'s `BRD_PACKAGE_NOT_INTERVIEWED`, which fires where `interview/` holds no round
record whatever the register holds, and there is no `not-interviewed` value to compute. Otherwise,
step 7 passes and step 8 fails →
`package_offerable: nothing-to-review`, which is not a defect in this run: every question was
settled from verified findings and the delivery team owes the customer no decision — save a
reopened `[CD#n]` waiting on the round this run worked, which the customer re-decides and which
takes the list of its own below. **Whatever the
state, name beside its list every requirement defect the round-1 test left waiting on an open
round** (*Resolve the round*), with the round it will be asked in: a package offered now goes out
without it, and the next one carries it. **Name beside it, too, every reopened record *A decision
reopened elsewhere* left waiting on the round this run worked**, with the bare
`/product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY>` that puts its question once every round is closed: it
may not be consumed downstream while it reads `reopened` (`decision-register-format.md` §3).

**`package_offerable: yes`:**

```
choices: ["Stop here — this round's decisions are recorded", "Package this BRD for customer review — /product-workflows:brd-package <BRD-KEY> <merge-clause>", "Work another round now — /product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY> (only if findings have changed, a requirement defect became this BRD's to ask, a re-grounding moved a decision's evidence, or another run reopened a decision — that last once every round is closed)", "Interview another BRD or slice"]
```

**`package_offerable: rounds-unsettled` — `/brd-package` is left out rather than offered and
refused:**

```
choices: ["Stop here — this round's decisions are recorded", "Work another round now — /product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY> (the questions named above are still in a holding state the packaging step refuses)", "Re-ground a question no finding bears on yet — /product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY>", "Interview another BRD or slice"]
```

**`package_offerable: defects-unasked` — name every `[DEF#n]` the *Resolve the round* phase
reported, and offer the re-open that asks them.** Do not call this BRD decided and do not offer the
packaging step: each of those defects is a business question only the customer can settle
(`interview-tagging.md` §1), no round holds a question for it yet, and a package built now would go
out without it. The re-open is `--round 1` with the cause *requirement defects became a question
source*: it re-opens round 1, and the round-1 test adds them there (*Resolve the round*). Where
step 7 fails as well — a later round this run opened or resumed holds a question in a holding state
the packaging step refuses — name those questions beside the list too, exactly as
`rounds-unsettled` does.

```
choices: ["Re-open round 1 to ask the requirement defects — /product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY> --round 1, cause: requirement defects became a question source (Recommended)", "Stop here — the requirement defects named above stay unasked", "Interview another BRD or slice"]
```

**`package_offerable: nothing-to-review` — say plainly that this BRD is decided, and do not offer
either the packaging step or another round of this command.** Both would stop or report a no-op: the
packaging step on its step-8 gate, and this command because it opens a new round only where a
question source puts a question on what changed after the last round was generated — the findings,
a requirement defect becoming this BRD's to ask, or a decision reopened; a record moved to
`reopened` raises its question through *A decision reopened elsewhere*, and one moved to
`superseded` raises nothing (*Resolve the round*) — and nothing here has changed. **The one
exception is a reopened record named waiting beside the list (above)**, and it takes its own list
below rather than this one. Such a record can only be a `[CD#n]` — a reopened `[VD#n]` is a
`[VD#n]` in the register, which step 8 counts — and a `[CD#n]` is re-decided by the customer, so
this BRD is neither decided nor free of customer review. Say that it holds a reopened decision, and
never present the array that says otherwise. Every round is closed in this state, so the bare run
opens the round that puts its question.
Of those changes, only the findings can be moved from here: a requirement defect becomes this BRD's to ask, and a decision is reopened, through events outside this command — for instance
`/product-workflows:brd-intake` re-run over a revised source the customer sends, an allocation or a
re-cut elsewhere under the parent, a sibling's `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` moving its row to
`rejected` or `superseded-by`, a sibling file that could not be read becoming readable, or a
`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` run reopening one of this BRD's decisions. So a fresh
grounding pass is what the list carries:

```
choices: ["Stop here — every question was settled from the findings and this BRD needs no customer review", "Re-ground every claim against current commits — /product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY> --rebaseline (a changed finding is what can make a new round askable)", "Interview another BRD or slice"]
```

**`package_offerable: nothing-to-review` with a reopened record waiting — name each record, with
what reopened it, and offer the round that puts it:**

```
choices: ["Stop here — the reopened decision named above waits for the next round", "Work another round now — /product-workflows:brd-interview <BRD-KEY> (puts the reopened decision's question again)", "Interview another BRD or slice"]
```

**Four of the five lists carry no `(Recommended)` marker, and that omission is deliberate**, per
the `When no option is safe to recommend` guidance in
`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "escalation-rules")`: on `yes`, `rounds-unsettled`,
`nothing-to-review` and its reopened-record list, which one is right depends entirely on what this round left behind.
**`defects-unasked` is the exception and is well-formed rather than an inconsistency**: its list is
shown only in its own state, and in it the marked step is the single one every path out goes through
— the re-open that asks questions only the customer can answer — which is precisely the first bullet
of that reference's `The (Recommended) marker is unconditional` section, where the condition gates
the prompt and the marker is therefore a plain one. What the gate above decides is only **whether
`/brd-package` appears at all**; it never promotes an option to recommended. A BRD both content
gates pass is ready to package; one either content gate refuses is not — which is why it is not
shown the option rather than shown it with a caveat. The `nothing-to-review` list carries no marker
for the same reason and one of its own: stopping there is a legitimate, finished outcome, and
marking a grounding pass "recommended" would imply this BRD is unfinished when it is not. Its
reopened-record list carries none because stopping there is legitimate too: the record waits, named,
until whoever owns the next round runs it.

`<merge-clause>` in that list is the placeholder `workflows-core:next-phase-offer` resolves from
this run's own `Phase handoff:` outcome line; it is never written as an unconditional "once the pull
request above is merged", because the no-new-round path reaches the handoff with nothing to commit
wherever the register was already on file, and then opens no pull request. **The two lists that name
`/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY>` — `rounds-unsettled` and `nothing-to-review` — carry no
clause at all, and that asymmetry is deliberate:** that command gates on `coverage-ledger.md`
(`commands/prd-ground.md` Phase 0 step 6), which this run never writes, so no handoff of this run's
can hold it up and there is no wait to state. **The `defects-unasked` re-open, and the reopened-record list's round, carry none
for the same reason**: this command gates on `grounding/code-grounding.md` (*Resolve inputs and gate the
grounded BRD*, step 6), which this run never writes either.

Say plainly what remains, per `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "next-phase-offer")` — names only,
never behaviour a command of its own owns: a round still holding a `[C]` stays open, because the
answer arrives through a package and is recorded by `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` once it comes
back. A
question in the *needs grounding* holding state — the one the *Resolve the round* phase defines as
movable only by a grounding run — is answered by re-running `/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY>`
and returning to this round, which is a real next step and is named as one. A requirement defect this
run withheld as undecidable is named with what decides it — the row it joins still `unallocated`, with
the BRD whose `/product-workflows:brd-split` run allocates it, or the sibling whose ledger or question
set could not be read — because until that changes no slice can tell whether to ask it.

### Context hygiene

The resume pointer is written in the terminal cost phase, per
`workflows-core:session-hygiene` §1. Working another round of the same BRD, or
going on to `/product-workflows:brd-package <BRD-KEY>`? Both stay in the PM lane
(§2's *Same role* bullet) → run **`/compact`**. Moving to a different BRD or slice? → run **`/clear`**. Guidance only — nothing is
auto-run.

---

## Phase 12 — Session maintenance, feedback & cost

Terminal phase — runs after *Next steps*, NEVER interrupts an earlier phase, and runs on the
no-new-round path exactly as on any other.

**Capture-at-block invariant.** If an EARLIER phase halts on a plugin / skill / command / reference
gap, `emit-block` (`workflows-core:feedback-emission`) fires at that halt before escalating. **One
of this command's stops qualifies, and the test is a rule rather than this list.**
`BRD_INTERVIEW_MALFORMED_FINDING` is a record-integrity gap of the plugin's own making: the keys it
finds in practice are `grounding-verifier`'s return fields, `own_verdict` above all, and those reach
a finding block only through a plugin command transcribing a return into the record — the same test
`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` applies to its `BRD_RECONCILE_READER_CONTRACT`, a gap whose
origin is the plugin's own dispatch — so it fires `emit-block` before the operator's hand repair.
Every other stop reports the state of the operator's own argument, the tree or the environment,
never a capability, reference or command path this plugin lacks, so a stop added later is classified
by the same test. Among them, the *Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD* stops that report the
operator's argument are argument halts — a missing or malformed key or `--round` value
(`BRD_INTERVIEW_BAD_ROUND`), an unresolved BRD, a resolved root BRD, a resolved Epic folder
(`BRD_INTERVIEW_EPIC_LEVEL`), an idea-route PRD folder (`BRD_INTERVIEW_NOT_A_SLICE` — the operator's
key naming a folder no BRD carved), and the no-parent form of `BRD_INTERVIEW_EMPTY_INVENTORY`, whose
key names a folder that is neither a slice nor a BRD container. The rest of that phase's stops are
environment / sequencing halts: an ungated or absent grounding deliverable, a grounding file on main
recording no finding (`BRD_INTERVIEW_NO_FINDINGS`), a slice's inventory carrying no claim at all
(`BRD_INTERVIEW_EMPTY_INVENTORY`'s slice form — a fact about what the parent allocated to this slice,
never about this plugin), a slice's inventory absent (`BRD_INTERVIEW_NO_INVENTORY` — never written,
by an interrupted `/brd-split` on the parent, or written and since lost), unverified findings, an unallocated ledger, and an unset `$SPECS_PATH`.
`BRD_INTERVIEW_NO_SUCH_ROUND` is an argument naming a round that does not exist,
`BRD_INTERVIEW_ROUND_STILL_OPEN` an argument naming a round that cannot open yet, and
`BRD_INTERVIEW_ALL_DELEGATED` — a BRD that kept no requirement of its own — is an allocation outcome
this command reports correctly, not a capability it lacks.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (subagent_type: "workflows-core:impl-maintenance", model:
   `<detection_model>`) with a compact handoff: command `/brd-interview`; what was produced (the round
   worked, the register entries written, the code-defect log when this round raised or
   re-dispositioned an entry, the `[C]` set held); key events (a re-opened round and its
   cause, a question that needed grounding, a will-change resolution, the torn writes an
   interrupted run left and this run removed, the no-new-round path — or "none"); workarounds; test result N/A; project root = the BRD folder.
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "feedback-emission emit-auto")` and call its `emit-auto` entry point (§6)
   with the Lessons Learned report, `command: /brd-interview`, the run's `key` (the
   `<BRD-KEY>`), `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Surface the persisted path (or "no
   plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted").
3. **Session cost (ALWAYS runs).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "cost-emission emit-cost")` and call its `emit-cost` entry point with `command: /brd-interview`, `phase: brd-to-prd`, `role: pm`, the
   run's `key`, `source`, and `plugin_version`. Surface the persisted path (or the report-only
   notice).
4. **Write the resume pointer.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "session-hygiene")` and, per its §1, write/overwrite `<BRD-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` now — after the cost entry, before the commit
   step below. Redact per §1. Silent.
5. **Commit session artifacts (terminal).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git commit-artifacts")` and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — the LAST action of the run. Stages ONLY the §2.1 bounded artifact paths inside
   `$SPECS_PATH`, commits `<BRD-KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (/brd-interview)` with no
   `Co-Authored-By` trailer, and pushes to the branch the handoff phase created. NEVER touches a code
   repo, a docs repo or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository; NEVER force-pushes; NEVER fails the
   run; skips entirely when the run carries `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting that notice.
   Hold its §6 outcome line for the final report.

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits the deliverable (git for the deliverable is
offered only in the handoff phase), and NEVER writes into a code/docs repo, or the current
working directory, where it is not the specs repository; no user name is ever written.

---

## Final report

Report: the BRD folder and which level it sits at; the classification and model routing
(+ any Opus degradation); **the round** — its number, and whether this run opened it, resumed it, or
re-opened it with the cause recorded; every torn write an interrupted run left, as the *Resolve
inputs and gate the grounded BRD* phase reported it, and whether this run removed it, with each
re-decision standing at a round no record names; **the question counts by tag**, `[G]` / `[V]` / `[C]`, and
every split, with the parts each original became; the `[G]` answers, each naming the
`[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` that settled it; **every re-tag, with the `NOT-PROVABLE` finding that caused it** —
never a re-tag reported without its cause; every question recorded *needs grounding*, named, with
`/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY>` as the fix; the round's requirement-defect account line,
and every defect withheld, with its cause — one that belongs to a closed round 1 with its re-open,
and one waiting on an open round with the round it will be asked in; every defect asked by a line
appended to its rejected row's held question, naming that question, and every one raised as a
question of its own because the held entry could not be chosen, naming the candidates;
the `[VD#n]` decided this run and any deferred; the `[AS#n]` recorded; the `[CDF#n]` raised this
round and the `[CDF#n]` re-dispositioned, each with its old and new disposition, when any; the `[C]` count held and the file
holding them, stated together with the fact that
`/product-workflows:brd-package` is the command that carries them to the customer and
`/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` the one that records the answer; every will-change resolution taken and how it was
recorded; every record *A decision the re-grounding moved* took — each held record this round put
again, with the question that puts it and, for a `[VD#n]` answered here, the record that superseded
it — or, where another run had left that record `withdrawn` or `superseded`, its status and the new
`[VD#n]` beside it, both as still needing a human; each plain record reopened, with its successor findings and the question that puts it, and, for one answered here that another run
had meanwhile left `withdrawn` or `superseded`, its status and the new `[VD#n]` beside it, both as
still needing a human; and each
such record that waits on an open round instead, with that round; every reopened record *A decision
reopened elsewhere* put again, with what reopened it and the question that puts it, and every one
that waits on an open round instead, with that round; every re-put `[V]` a resumed round recorded
*decided* from a re-decision a stopped run left standing, naming the record; every reopened record a
propagation sweep reverted while its re-put `[V]` waited, answered here, with the new `[VD#n]` that
superseded it; every held record waiting on its
prerequisite, with the successor still `will-change` and the prerequisite it names; and every plain
record whose successors confirmed it, which raised nothing; the count of decisions and assumptions still `consumed_by: none`
(`decision-register-format.md` §1); whether the round closed or stays open, and what it is waiting on;
the feedback + cost paths; the `Phase handoff:` outcome line (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.1); the
`Specs repo:` outcome line (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §6); the next-step recommendation; and end with the
ledger line, read fresh from the (unmodified-by-this-run) `coverage-ledger.md`, exactly per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §6:

```
ledger: <N> requirements — <covered> covered, <deferred> deferred, <rejected> rejected, <unallocated> unallocated, <unresolved> unresolved (<delegated> delegated, <not-built> not built)
```

`/brd-interview` never changes a ledger disposition — the line simply reports where allocation
stands. **Reporting it reads one ledger per `covered-by` row**, one hop, from the working tree
via `resolve-address` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3), per `coverage-ledger-format.md` §6.1 — this run always stands on a slice
(step 6 already confirmed `grounding/code-grounding.md` is on main, and that file is created only
by `/prd-ground`, which itself refuses to run on a root — every later writer only stamps
`consumed_by` on findings already in it), so that is always a sibling or
the parent (§3); a ledger that cannot
be read there contributes `unresolved`, never `covered` (§6.2). This adds no precondition and no
gate: the allocation gate in *Resolve inputs and gate the grounded BRD* is decided on this BRD's own
rows before any of this, and a non-zero `unallocated` term in the line — a row this BRD delegated to
a child that has not walked it yet — is that resolution working, never this run having failed. A slice does **not** always reach this with
nothing to resolve: it can hold **orphan rows** (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §2) — ledger rows for a
`[BR#n]` this slice no longer claims, reached by any of §2's three routes. §6.1 counts every one of
them through the parent's current disposition for its `[BR#n]`, never as it reads, and resolves a
`covered-by` that disposition maps to one hop — into a sibling or the parent (§3) — exactly as it
resolves a parent's delegated rows, so on a slice this line also reads the parent's own
`coverage-ledger.md`. So a slice's line reports zero delegated only when its parent withdrew none of
its claims — provisional, committed, or settled here before the parent re-allocated it, the three
routes to an orphan row (§2) — never as a property of being a slice.
