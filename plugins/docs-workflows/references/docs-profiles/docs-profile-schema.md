# docs-profile schema

`/docs-profile` writes this file to **`.dev-workflows/docs-profile.yml`** at
the target docs repo's git work-tree top level (**Where the profile lives**,
below), and `/docs-init` writes the first one when it scaffolds that repo.
`/document`, `/docs-serve` and `/docs-brand` read it, as do the
`docs-frontmatter` skill and its reminder hook. `changelog` and `owners` are
intentionally absent — they are owned by the `docs-frontmatter` skill.

## Where the profile lives

**One home: the git work-tree top level of the resolved docs repository.** Whatever directory a command resolved — through `repo-resolution.md`'s `resolve-docs-repo`, or `/document`'s own Phase 0 ladder — its profile is `<top>/.dev-workflows/docs-profile.yml`, where `<top>` is what `git -C <resolved> rev-parse --show-toplevel` prints, or the resolved directory itself where it is in no git work tree. The resolved directory can sit below that top level — a Docusaurus `website/` in a monorepo, a `site/` beside the code — and the profile still lives at the top level, never beside the site: one repository has one profile however many content roots it publishes, as the two-space example below does. It is where `/docs-profile` has always written the file, so no existing profile moves.

- **Every path the profile records is relative to that top level** — `spaces[].content_root` and `snippet_root`, `builds[].config` and `out`, `announcement_pages[].path`, `images.root`. A site under `site/` records `content_root: site/docs`, never `docs`.
- **Every command it records runs from that top level** — every `commands.*` and `commands.per_space.*` value, every `builds[].command` and every `dev_servers.servers[].command` — so a site below it names its config from there: `mkdocs serve -f site/mkdocs.yml -a 0.0.0.0:{port}`.
- **`/docs-serve`'s state file sits beside it**, at `<top>/.dev-workflows/docs-serve.state.json`.

A command resolves `<top>` once, from the directory it resolved, and reads the profile, runs its commands and keeps that state file there — never in a directory below it.

## Field rules
- `frontmatter.owners_spaces` lists the `spaces[].id` values whose pages require an owners block. Absent or empty means the owners check never fires. It is read by the `changelog-owners-reminder` hook and by the `docs-frontmatter` skill; neither hardcodes a content root, so a repo supplying its own profile gets its own roots and its own owners policy.
- `spaces[]` is required and non-empty. It is a plain list of the repo's content roots: a repo publishing one documentation set has one entry, a repo publishing several has one per set. A page belongs to whichever entry's `content_root`/`snippet_root` prefixes its path, and is written there and nowhere else.
- `generator` is optional — it records which generator produced the repo (for example `mkdocs-material`). It is **informational only**: no consumer branches on its value, and every build, lint, format and serve invocation goes through `commands.*` and `dev_servers.*` regardless of what it says. That is what makes the generator choice reversible behind the profile — the whole reason the field is allowed to exist.
- `builds[]` is optional — a list of `{id, config, command, out, visibility}` entries for a repo whose ONE content root renders into more than one output. It is not a second `spaces[]` entry: `spaces[]` is defined by content-root ownership — a page belongs to whichever entry's `content_root` prefixes its path — so two spaces sharing one root breaks that rule. Two builds over one root is a different axis and needs its own field. The worked example above stays two-space/pnpm and does not carry `generator`/`builds[]` — a repo cannot coherently run two mutually exclusive build toolchains. A single-content-root MkDocs repo, the shape `/docs-init` scaffolds, declares them like this:

  ```yaml
  generator: mkdocs-material            # informational; consumers still go through commands.*
  builds:
    - { id: public,   config: mkdocs.yml,          command: "mkdocs build --strict -f mkdocs.yml",          out: site,          visibility: public }
    - { id: internal, config: mkdocs.internal.yml, command: "mkdocs build --strict -f mkdocs.internal.yml", out: site-internal, visibility: internal }
  ```
- `dev_servers.concurrent` is optional. `false` means the profile's servers cannot run at once — the worked example's two pnpm spaces cannot — so a consumer starts them one at a time, and `/docs-serve` starts none of them while another is known to be running (`DOCS_SERVE_NOT_CONCURRENT`). Absent, or `true`, the profile sets no such limit: `/docs-init` writes no `concurrent` key, since its public and internal servers run side by side, each on its own port over the one content root.
- `dev_servers.readiness_timeout_seconds` is optional (default 120) — how many seconds a consumer polls a server it started for readiness: `/document`'s Phase 6.5 before falling back to the manual table, and `/docs-serve`'s Phase 5 before reporting a timeout, which leaves the server running and records its entry without a pid but with the process group it started it in, so `--stop` can still end it. Both stop polling sooner where the process group they started the server in is gone, and report the command's exit instead of a timeout.
- `dev_servers.servers[].command` may carry the literal token `{port}`, standing where the command's own tool takes its port — `mkdocs serve -f mkdocs.yml -a 0.0.0.0:{port}` is how `/docs-init` writes it. **Every consumer that runs the command replaces every `{port}` in it with the port it serves on, and never runs a command with the token unsubstituted**: `/docs-serve` substitutes the configured `port`, its `--port <n>`, or the port a collision moved it to; `/document`'s render check substitutes the configured `port`. The substitution touches the token and nothing else — no other part of a command is ever rewritten, and the bind address stays the command's own concern (`/docs-serve` reports a command that binds only loopback as a profile defect rather than patching it). **What the token buys is a port a consumer can choose**: a command without it binds a port of its own, which no consumer can move. `/docs-serve` calls such a command **fixed-port** — a collision on it is reported with what holds the port instead of falling forward to the next free one, and `--port <n>` on it stops — and its `port` must be the port the command actually binds, since that is where every consumer looks for it. To add the token by hand, put `{port}` where the command already names its port, as above. Where the port lives inside a script the command runs — the worked example's `pnpm cloud:start` — whether a port can be passed from outside at all, by which flag, and whether the script forwards it to its tool, all depend on that tool, so check that tool's own documentation first; no consumer guesses it, and `/docs-profile` never writes the token anywhere but in place of a port the command already names.
- Where the operator can, record a `dev_servers.servers[].command` whose tool keeps the command line it was given — `node_modules/.bin/vitepress dev docs --host 0.0.0.0 --port {port} --strictPort` rather than a launcher that rewrites its own as it runs — since `/docs-serve` identifies a server by the command line its process carries and allows for one launcher rewrite only, `npx <rest>` becoming `npm exec <rest>`; it compares the two with every quote removed and each run of whitespace collapsed, which undoes the shell's own quoting and nothing more. It carries `--strictPort` because a command binds the port it is given, or fails (below).
- `dev_servers.servers[].command` keeps its server **in the foreground**: it runs the server as one of its own processes and never detaches it — no `setsid`, no `nohup … &`, no trailing `&`, and no detach flag such as `docker run -d` or `docker compose up -d`. **A detaching command is a profile defect, like a loopback-only bind**: fix the command, not the consumer. Both consumers that start a server depend on this, because each tracks what it started. `/document`'s render check stops a server by the process group its start created, and a server moved out of that group — by `setsid` into a session of its own, or by `docker run -d` into a container — is one the check can neither stop nor see bind after it has moved on (`references/docs-profiles/render-verification.md` §2). `/docs-serve` starts a server in a process group of its own too, follows it through that group, and records a pid for it only where the port's listener is in its own checkout, so a server detached out of both — into a container above all, whose published port is held by a process elsewhere or by none the socket table shows — leaves `--stop` nothing to stop it by. **A foreground `docker run -p …` or `docker compose up` keeps to this rule, yet `/docs-serve` cannot identify the server it starts**: the port it publishes is held by Docker's forwarding — a `docker-proxy`, the kernel's NAT, or rootless Docker's own port driver — never by a process of the command's, so no process on that port carries the recorded command. Where the socket table shows no process there — a root `docker-proxy`, or NAT — its Phase 5 records the entry without a pid, as it does for any port whose process the table does not show, and its `--stop` can signal only the process group it started, which holds the `docker` client and never the container. Where the table shows a process Docker started outside the checkout, the run names it as another checkout's and records nothing. Either way, stop the container with Docker. **A tool can detach itself, too, and Astro 7 does wherever it detects an AI coding agent** — Claude Code, whose shell sets `CLAUDECODE`, among them: `astro dev` then re-spawns the server as a detached process of its own, its arguments rebuilt from the flags Astro knows, and returns, so both consumers meet a boot whose group is gone while something else serves the port. Astro documents the opt-out, the `ASTRO_DEV_BACKGROUND` environment variable, and an Astro command sets it ahead of the tool — `ASTRO_DEV_BACKGROUND=0 node_modules/.bin/astro dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port {port}` — which keeps the server in the foreground, in the group its start created (Astro 7.3.2, run under Claude Code); an `astro dev` command without it detaches, a profile defect like any other.
- `dev_servers.servers[].command` **binds the port it is given, or fails** — the port its `{port}` token carries, or, for a fixed-port command, the port it names itself, which its entry's `port` must be. **A command that moves itself to another port when its own is busy is a profile defect, like a loopback-only bind**: fix the command, not the consumer. Both consumers that start a server poll the port they gave it, and `/docs-serve` matches a server's process by the port its command line carries, so a copy that moved serves where nothing looks for it: `/docs-serve` records nothing for it, cannot name it on a later run, and can start a second copy beside it. Vite-based tools move by default — Vite takes the next free port — and each is pinned its own way: **where a tool's command line cannot pin the port, its configuration must**. VitePress takes `--strictPort`, which makes a busy port an error. Astro takes no such flag — `astro dev --strictPort` still moves off a busy port, and so does a `server: { strictPort: true }` in its configuration, a key Astro's own `server` block does not read — so an Astro site pins it with Vite's own setting in `astro.config.*`, `vite: { server: { strictPort: true } }`, and a busy port then stops it with *"Port <port> is already in use"* (Astro 7.3.2 and VitePress 1.6.4, each run against a held port).
- `dev_servers.servers[].public_base_url` is optional — the externally reachable URL for that server, distinct from `port`. A command running inside a container cannot infer the host's published port mapping, so a consumer reports this value instead of guessing; when it is absent, the consumer reports the in-container URL with an explicit caveat rather than a URL that may not open. The worked example above deliberately publishes each server on a different host port than it binds to — that mismatch is the point the field exists to cover, not a typo; a `public_base_url` that always equalled its `port` would teach a reader that the field is redundant.
- `dev_servers.servers[].visibility` is optional, taking `public | internal`. It pairs a server with the `builds[]` entry of the same visibility — the two-build MkDocs shape `/docs-init` scaffolds records two `dev_servers.servers[]` entries this way, one per build, which is what lets a consumer honour the split without re-deriving it from a command string: `/docs-serve` its `--internal`/public selection, and `/document`'s render check the choice of the server that publishes each page (`references/docs-profiles/render-verification.md` §2). It is optional because a repo with one server needs no split to record. The worked two-space example above tags neither of its two servers with it: `cloud` and `self-hosted` differ by **space**, not by **visibility** — two different axes, and tagging that example would teach the wrong one.
- `commands.per_space` is optional — a map keyed by a space id from `spaces[]`, each entry carrying any of `lint`, `build`, `format`. A repo that lints or builds each content root separately declares it here; consumers run the **lint** command for each space that owns a written file, and — on a profile that records no `builds[]` — the **build** command for every space in the render verification set (`references/docs-profiles/render-verification.md` §1–§2). Both fall back to the flat `commands.lint` / `commands.build` when the map is absent. A space id in `per_space` that is not in `spaces[]` is a profile error. A per-space entry carrying only some of `lint`/`build`/`format` is not specified — no shipped profile does it. A consumer meeting one should surface the gap rather than guess which fallback applies.
- `commands.build` (flat) and `commands.per_space.<space>.build` are both optional, and `builds[]`, where a profile records it, comes before both: `/document`'s gating build check runs **every** `builds[]` entry's `command` and neither of the other two, and `/docs-serve --build` looks there first too (`references/docs-profiles/render-verification.md` §1). When none of the three exists, the consumer treats the dev-server boot as the build proof. Declare a build command whenever the repo has one — an absent build command disables `/document`'s gating build check.
- `commit_convention` is optional — the squash commit-message format Phase 8.5 uses. When absent, the consumer infers it from recent `git log` / `CONTRIBUTING`, else falls back to `<KEY> <summary>`.
- `announcement_pages` is optional — hand-authored destination pages that receive a given class of change regardless of where the feature itself is documented, typically inside a tree that is otherwise automation-owned. A repo without any omits the block. Each entry is `{postid, path, kinds}`; `kinds` is an open list of change kinds. `path` is authoritative when `path` and `postid` disagree; `postid` alone suffices when the repo's link convention is postid-based. A declared page is a **cross-cutting** destination: `doc-location-finder` proposes it whichever content root it sits under, even one no other target in the run touched.
- `frontmatter.*` are pointers; never copy the rules here.
- `images.policy` is one of `in-repo` (scaffold default), `object-store`, or `cdn` (D16) — replacing the free-text sentence this field used to carry. Every rule the old sentence stated is preserved below, under the policy it describes:
  - `in-repo`: the file is committed under `images.root` (default `docs/assets`) and referenced by relative path. A replacement overwrites the same path — one path per slot, never a new filename beside the old one. `images.max_bytes` (default 307200, 300 KB) is the CI budget checked per image; SVG is preferred, then optimised PNG.
  - `object-store`: an S3-compatible bucket, with the same overwrite-in-place rule as `in-repo` (bucket versioning covers it), plus two obligations `in-repo` does not carry — an orphan sweep (deleting a page does not delete its objects, and an unreferenced object is invisible and paid for forever) and a third visibility gate: every image URL in the public build must resolve to `images.public_prefix`, with internal media under `images.internal_prefix`.
  - `cdn`: the human uploads to the CDN and supplies the URL; docs reference it and no binary is ever committed. A CDN URL is immutable, so an image is never refreshed in place — every new or replacing screenshot is a new URL under `images.public_prefix`, and the docs edit is always a URL swap.
- `images.root` and `images.max_bytes` apply to `in-repo` only; `images.public_prefix` applies to `object-store` and `cdn`; `images.internal_prefix` applies to `object-store` only — a consumer reading a field its policy does not use treats it as unset.
