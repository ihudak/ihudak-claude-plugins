# Fires on every message submission. Matches /implement, /vuln, /upgrade —
# bare or prefixed with this plugin's own namespace (e.g.
# /dev-workflows:implement) — and routes per spec §3:
#   • /implement, /vuln, /upgrade       → full (model-routing + git status +
#                                         recent commits + small-repo directory
#                                         listing); /implement also preloads
#                                         specs context when its argument is a
#                                         address (keyed — /implement resolves
#                                         its own argument via resolve-address)
#
# /epics moved to the companion pm-workflows plugin along with the command
# itself. Its preload row — specs + repos context, no model-routing, no full
# status/log, no directory listing — now ships from pm-workflows's own
# preload-context.sh, carried across intact rather than re-derived.
#
# emit_specs_context surfaces $SPECS_PATH alongside $REPOS_PATH.
#
# Two sibling plugins each ship a hook of this name, one regex apiece:
# docs-workflows covers /document and /release-notes; pm-workflows covers
# /epics. A UserPromptSubmit hook fires whichever plugin ships it, so all
# three run on every prompt. Disjointness holds two ways at once: the three
# bare-command alternations share no command name across the three plugins,
# and the optional plugin-name prefix each regex now also accepts is a
# literal, distinct string per plugin — so no single prompt can match more
# than one of the three.
#
# Exits immediately (near-zero overhead) if the message doesn't match.
# Always exits 0 — must never block Claude.

# Guard: if python3 is not available, skip silently
