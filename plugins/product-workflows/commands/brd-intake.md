name: brd-intake
description: BRD-intake workflow (PM phase, entry point of the BRD-to-PRD flow). Walks every link a customer-supplied business requirements document makes — wikilinks included — read-only, shows the operator the list and asks before capturing anything outside the document's folder or anything it cannot read, then copies the document and every file it takes into the specs repo byte-for-byte, naming in brd/brd-link-log.md each link in a copied file whose target it did not copy, and why. figure-reader transcribes every linked image the run takes into brd/brd-figures.md, and brd-reader extracts a [BR#n] requirement inventory from the document, its linked markdown and those transcriptions; its defect candidates are confirmed interactively against the six brd-format.md classes, and a coverage-ledger.md is written with every row unallocated. Rejects a non-markdown source rather than converting it. Grounds on the shipped product documentation when $DOCS_PATH resolves (--no-docs off), consumed grill-rank over the defect walk. Optional --sort-existing migrates an already-hand-written package into seed files. Offers /brd-split as the next step.

Intake the customer-supplied business requirements document: $ARGUMENTS

**Core references.** A citation of the form `workflows-core:<name>` names a shared reference in the `workflows-core` plugin. Load it with `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "<name>")` — never by path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to this plugin, which does not carry it.

`/brd-intake` is the **entry point of the BRD-to-PRD flow** (PM phase) — the first of the
route's commands, which between them turn a long, often internally
contradictory customer BRD into requirements a PRD can be built from. It copies the customer's
source into the specs repo **verbatim and immutably**, extracts a `[BR#n]` requirement inventory
via the `brd-reader` agent, classifies the document's defects **with a human** rather than on the
agent's say-so alone, and writes a coverage ledger in which every requirement starts life
`unallocated` — the state `/brd-split`, the route's allocation step, cannot complete past until each
row has been given a fate.

Usage: `/brd-intake <BRD-KEY> @<brd-file> [--sort-existing <dir>] [--no-docs] [--docs <path>]`

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve inputs

1. **`<BRD-KEY>` (mandatory).** Parse the first token that is neither a flag, nor a flag's value, nor the `@<brd-file>` argument — `--sort-existing` and `--docs` each consume the token after them (step 4), and a value skipped as "non-flag" would be read as the key; a token opening with `@` is step 2's source wherever it stands, so an operator who types the path first is not told the key is missing; validate it with `key-valid`
   (`workflows-core:addressing` §1's `key-valid` — shape only,
   never checked against a tracker). If absent or invalid, **stop gracefully**:
   `BRD_INTAKE_NEEDS_KEY: /brd-intake needs a BRD key (shape ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*(-\d+)+$, e.g. ACME-001) — pick a short stable identifier for this business requirements document, then re-run '/product-workflows:brd-intake <KEY> @<brd-file>'.`
2. **`@<brd-file>` (mandatory).** The customer's source file argument. If absent, **stop**:
   `BRD_INTAKE_NEEDS_SOURCE: /brd-intake needs the customer's source as an @-argument — re-run '/product-workflows:brd-intake <KEY> @<path-to-brd>'.`
3. **Reject a PDF — do not convert it.** If the resolved source does not end in `.md`/`.markdown`
   (a PDF, a Word document, a slide deck, any non-markdown source), **stop**:
   `BRD_INTAKE_NEEDS_MARKDOWN: the source must be markdown — convert it first, and check the conversion. It becomes the immutable record every [BR#n] anchors into.`
   The reason this is a hard stop rather than a best-effort conversion: once intaken, `brd/source/`
   is never edited again (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1), and every `[BR#n]`
   locates itself inside that text by `source_anchor`. An unchecked machine conversion — a dropped
   clause, a misplaced heading, a table read out of row order — would silently become the record of
   what the customer asked for, with no later step positioned to catch it. Converting is the
   operator's own step, done where they can eyeball the result against the original before handing
   it back to this command.
4. **Optional flags.** `--sort-existing <dir>` — if present, validate `<dir>` exists and carry it
   forward to Phase 6. `--docs <path>` — points documentation grounding at that root for this run instead of `${DOCS_PATH:-/workspace/docs}`; **strip the flag and its value together** before any remaining-argument classification, or the path is read as part of the address. Declared for every consumer by `workflows-core:docs-grounding` *Procedure* step 1 (*Flags first*), which resolves it; this command only has to recognise it and pass the invocation through. `--no-docs` — boolean; turns documentation grounding off for this run,
   carried to Phase 1's `resolve-docs-grounding` call. **None of the three changes anything else about Phase 0:**
   the BRD source is still required and still gated by step 3.
5. **`$SPECS_PATH` (required).** If unset, stop naming `SPECS_PATH`, per the
   `Required path environment variable unset` rule in `workflows-core:escalation-rules`:
   ```
   choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]
   ```
6. **Specs-repo preflight.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git specs-preflight")` and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline. Prompt-free and silent when the specs repo is
   clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5 notice; if it returns
   `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag for the whole run — the terminal
   `commit-artifacts` step skips on it.
7. **Resolve or derive the BRD folder** via `resolve-address <BRD-KEY>` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3). Found → an existing folder, and where it is a
   root BRD this invocation is a re-run over it; use it. Only a root is: the slice test below and the
   level test after it refuse every other folder. **A slice is never a legitimate target here** —
   it has no source document of its own to intake, and its inventory and ledger are created by the
   parent's `/brd-split` (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2.1,
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §3) — so a resolved folder whose
   `brd-link.md` carries a `parent:` field is a mis-keyed invocation, and the run **stops** on it.
   Take this refusal **here, before the re-run confirmation below is composed**, and note that it
   keys on `parent:` rather than on rows because neither of the two states a slice can be in is
   safe. A slice that claims any row holds an inventory with those rows in it, `/brd-split` having
   copied the parent's in, so there that confirmation would otherwise fire and be the only array
   the operator sees on this path — an array whose keeps-and-changes list and whose disposition
   warning are both written for a source-owning root, and whose *Re-run over this folder* answer
   sends Phase 2 on to write `brd/source/` into a folder that holds none, Phase 3 to renumber rows
   §2.1 says are never re-extracted, and Phase 5 to replace every `covered-here` the allocate-only
   walk recorded with `unallocated`. Nothing short of git recovers that. And on a **standing empty
   child** — one kept with `claims: []` against a recorded `reason:`
   (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3), whose inventory holds its header and no row,
   which this step's own test reads as no prior inventory at all — that confirmation is skipped
   silently, so Phase 2 would write into the slice with no consent asked anywhere. Stop, on a slice:
   `BRD_INTAKE_SLICE: <BRD-KEY> resolves to a slice of <the parent: field of its own brd-link.md>, and a slice has no source document to intake — the source and the records beside it under brd/ are the parent's, one hop, and the slice's own brd/brd-inventory.md and coverage-ledger.md are created by '/product-workflows:brd-split' on the parent. Re-intake the parent with '/product-workflows:brd-intake <PARENT-KEY> <the @<brd-file> this run was given>'; that run leaves every row of the parent's ledger unallocated, so re-take the dispositions with the root walk it offers you when it finishes, '/product-workflows:brd-split <PARENT-KEY> "<how to cut it>"', and only then re-allocate a slice the walk left a row unallocated in, with '/product-workflows:prd-ground <SLICE-KEY>' and then '/product-workflows:brd-split <SLICE-KEY>'.`
   **Four of the six slots are substituted and two stay literal, and the text says which.**
   `<PARENT-KEY>`, and the slot naming the `parent:` field in the stop's first sentence, are both
   that `parent:` field as it reads, never a key parsed out of the folder's name
   (`CLAUDE.md`, *Resolve an identifier against a known set*); `<BRD-KEY>` is the address typed; and
   the source is the `@<brd-file>` this invocation was given, substituted exactly as typed — the run
   holds it, and it is telling the operator to re-type it against a different key.
   `"<how to cut it>"` stays literal, as Phase 8 prints its own copy, because the slicing
   instruction is the operator's to write; and `<SLICE-KEY>` stays literal because the root walk
   that would carve or confirm that slice has not run yet. **The `brd/` half is stated by what is
   the parent's rather than by the directory**: a slice *does* hold a `brd/` of its own, holding
   exactly `brd/brd-inventory.md` (`brd-format.md` §2.1) — which is why naming the whole directory
   the parent's would contradict the clause after it.

   **A found folder that is not a BRD at all is refused here too, just after the slice test and
   before the re-run confirmation below is composed.** `resolve-address` searches every level
   `workflows-core:addressing` §3 bounds, so a key naming an idea-route PRD folder or an Epic folder
   resolves here exactly as a BRD's does, and *Found* above once read every such folder as a re-run
   over a BRD. Neither holds a `brd/brd-inventory.md`, so the confirmation below is skipped silently
   on both, and Phase 2 would copy the customer's document into the folder, Phase 3 write an
   inventory there and Phase 5 a coverage ledger beside a `prd.md` or an `epic.md` — a folder
   afterwards half one route and half the other, with a customer's source inside a folder that
   belongs to neither. Place the found folder as `workflows-core:addressing` §4.1
   places it — by its kind prefix, and, where it carries none, by §4.1's positive evidence in §4.1's
   order, the container test first, so a legacy root BRD is never placed below it — and never by the
   kind its carrier asserts:
   - **A container** — a `BRD-` folder, or an unprefixed one §4.1's first test places there → the
     re-run below. This is the one found folder this command runs on.
   - **Epic-level** — an `EPIC-` folder, or an unprefixed one resolved `kind: epic`. Stop:
     `BRD_INTAKE_EPIC_LEVEL: <BRD-KEY> resolves to an existing Epic folder at <path>, not a BRD — nothing was copied or written. A customer's BRD is intaken into a BRD- folder of its own, which this command creates only where the key resolves to no folder at all, and an Epic is refined from the PRD folder above it, never intaken into. Re-run '/product-workflows:brd-intake <NEW-KEY> <the @<brd-file> this run was given>' with a key no folder under $SPECS_PATH/specifications/ asserts; this Epic folder is left exactly as it stands. Re-running with this key stops here again.`
   - **PRD-level, and not the slice refused above** — a `PRD-` folder, or an unprefixed one resolved
     `kind: prd` — and **anything §4.1 places at no level**, which §4.1 never guesses at. Stop:
     `BRD_INTAKE_NOT_A_BRD: <BRD-KEY> resolves to an existing folder at <path> that is not a BRD — <a PRD folder carrying no brd-link.md naming a parent:, so an idea-route one no BRD carved | a folder carrying <what it carries>, which addressing.md §4.1 places at no level> — and nothing was copied or written. A customer's BRD is intaken into a BRD- folder of its own, which this command creates only where the key resolves to no folder at all. Re-run '/product-workflows:brd-intake <NEW-KEY> <the @<brd-file> this run was given>' with a key no folder under $SPECS_PATH/specifications/ asserts; this folder is left exactly as it stands. Re-running with this key stops here again.`

   `<NEW-KEY>` stays literal — choosing a key is the operator's — and the source is substituted
   exactly as typed, as in `BRD_INTAKE_SLICE`. **Neither stop names a command for the folder it
   refused**: what runs next on an idea-route PRD folder or an Epic depends on what that folder
   already holds, which this command has not read and has no reason to, and a remedy naming a run
   that refuses the folder would be worse than none. Both are argument halts, so `emit-block` does
   not fire (Phase 9). Absent → this is a
   brand-new BRD: derive `<slug>` from the source file's first heading — lowercase it, turn every run
   of characters outside `[a-z0-9]` into one `-`, and trim `-` from both ends, so
   `Acme reporting — business requirements` gives `acme-reporting-business-requirements` — falling
   back to the same rule over the source filename less its extension where no heading is found or
   the heading leaves nothing, and to `brd` where that leaves nothing too; then prepare to create
   `specifications/BRD-<BRD-KEY>-<slug>/` — **the `BRD-` kind prefix is part of the name**
   (`workflows-core:addressing` §2), never optional and never derived from the
   key. The directory is not actually created until Phase 2's first write.

   **Writing it unprefixed is the pre-prefix shape §5 exists to tolerate, never to produce**, and
   the cost is not cosmetic. A folder created without the prefix misses `workflows-core:addressing` §3's
   `*-<KEY>-*` glob by construction, so every downstream run resolves it through §5's legacy
   fallback and reports it `legacy: true` — deprecated, once per run — on a tree this command wrote
   minutes earlier. Worse, the container refusals `/product-workflows:create-prd`,
   `/product-workflows:create-ard`, `/product-workflows:specify` and `/product-workflows:epics` each read
   the `BRD-` prefix off the resolved folder's **own name**, falling through to
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5.1's positive test only for a
   folder that has none — so an unprefixed root BRD moves all four refusals onto the legacy branch
   they hold for repositories written before increment A. **What is *not* a cost is the slice**:
   `/product-workflows:brd-split` Phase 3 step 2 creates each child **inside the folder that run
   resolved**, taking the parent half of the path from that folder's own name on disk and never
   re-deriving it from `<PARENT-KEY>` — it says so in bold, gives this exact case as its reason, and
   cites this step back for it — so an unprefixed root still gets correctly nested `PRD-` children.
   `workflows-core:addressing` §5 keeps resolving the folders
   a pre-prefix repo already holds; this command does not add to them.


   **A re-run over an existing root BRD folder re-reads the source and rewrites the inventory, the ledger and
   the records beside them, and the confirmation for that is taken here — before Phase 2's first
   write.** Where the folder resolved above already holds a `brd/brd-inventory.md` with at least one
   row — an earlier intake's; one holding its header and no row is no prior inventory (Phase 3) —
   read it, and the `coverage-ledger.md` beside it, and state before anything is copied:
   - **what the re-run keeps**: every `[BR#n]` id, a row the new read does not find again included
     (Phase 3); each row's `text` wherever the file its anchor points into is unchanged since the
     inventory's rows were last reconciled — judged against the inventory's own record of that,
     never against the copy on disk (Phase 2); every `[DEF#n]` the defect log holds, with its reason
     and its resolution (Phase 4); the transcription of every image whose bytes are unchanged
     (Phase 2.5); every account the operator gave for a section or an image holding no row,
     where the section's file or the image is unchanged and it still holds none; and every row a
     quote of the operator's added, which no read returns and which the run reports in its own
     words rather than as one it failed to re-extract (Phase 3);
   - **what it may change**: the copy of each file whose bytes changed is replaced (Phase 2), and a
     row anchored in a file recorded **replaced** may take the new read's wording — the document
     counts as replaced wherever its bytes differ from those the inventory records for the document
     its rows were last reconciled against, the one its `document:` names, **whatever either is
     called**, so a revised document sent under a new filename rewords the rows anchored in it, its
     earlier copy staying beside it; and every file whose copy already stands, the document with
     them, counts as replaced, once, where the inventory was written before 3.7.0 and records no
     hash to judge against (Phase 2). A requirement the read finds for the first time takes the next
     id, and where a returned row over an unchanged file could be a kept row reworded, you are asked
     which (Phase 3); a candidate not already logged is walked again (Phase 4) — and **every ledger
     disposition is replaced with `unallocated`** (Phase 5): no disposition is kept. The one
     exception is a read that finds no requirement at all, which leaves the inventory, the defect log
     and the ledger exactly as they stand (Phase 3's `EMPTY`).

   Where the ledger holds any row not `unallocated`, name the dispositions that last point destroys:
   how many rows carry each terminal disposition and which `[BR#n]`s they are — `covered-by`,
   `deferred-to`, `rejected`, `superseded-by`, and any illegal root `covered-here`
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5). Name what that destroys rather
   than calling it a rewrite: each `deferred-to`, `rejected` and `superseded-by` decision
   `/product-workflows:brd-split`'s walk took is discarded and has to be re-taken, a `rejected` row
   re-cited against its `[DEF#n]` — which is still there to cite, because a re-run keeps every entry
   the defect log holds, id and resolution unchanged (Phase 4) — and every child's `claims:`
   re-allocated. Then ask:
   ```
   choices: ["Re-run over this folder — keeping and changing exactly what is listed above", "Cancel — leave this BRD as it stands"]
   ```
   **Neither option carries a `(Recommended)` marker, and the omission is deliberate** per the
   `When no option is safe to recommend` guidance in
   `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "escalation-rules")`, as Phase 8's zero-row list
   states it for its own: whether this run is the re-intake the operator meant or the one they typed
   by mistake is a judgement about their own intent and about the customer's document, and nothing
   the run holds distinguishes the two — the folder looks the same either way. Present the array as
   it stands; substitute nothing into it.
   **Here and not in Phase 5, because declining is free only until Phase 2's first write.** By
   Phase 5 a revised file's copy has been replaced and the inventory re-extracted, so a decline there
   would leave the folder holding an inventory its standing ledger no longer matches — a worse state
   than either answer to this question. On `Cancel` nothing is written at all. **It is asked whether
   or not any disposition stands**: a ledger whose every row is still `unallocated` has nothing to
   discard, but the re-run still rewrites the inventory, and an operator who re-runs by mistake
   deserves to be told so before it does. Where the folder holds no inventory row, there is nothing
   to keep or discard and this confirmation is skipped silently.

   **A single illegal root `covered-here` row does not need this run**, and the offer says so rather
   than letting a re-run be taken for the only exit: `coverage-ledger-format.md` §5 names the
   one-row hand repair that leaves every other disposition standing, and the container refusals of
   `/product-workflows:create-prd`, `/product-workflows:create-ard`, `/product-workflows:specify` and
   `/product-workflows:epics` offer that repair first and this re-run second.

`/brd-intake` is the **first command of the BRD-to-PRD route** — unlike every downstream `/brd-*`
command, it consumes no prior phase's deliverable, so it runs no `require-on-main` gate here. It is
cwd-agnostic and needs no repos mounted (no `$REPOS_PATH`); grounding against code and design is
`/prd-ground`'s job, not this one's.

---

## Phase 1 — Confirm

Show, and confirm before writing anything:

- The BRD folder (existing, or the derived `BRD-<BRD-KEY>-<slug>` to be created — the `BRD-`
  prefix included, per `workflows-core:addressing` §2).
- The resolved absolute path to `@<brd-file>`, **and its own directory**. **Run the walk
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/linked-sources.md` §4 defines, from the document, now** — it is
  read-only: it copies nothing, writes nothing and dispatches nothing. Show what it found: how many
  linked files of each kind — **markdown**, **image**, **other** — inside the document's own directory
  and outside it, and every target it could not resolve, with its reason (`url`, `unreadable`, or
  `ambiguous` with every candidate). Name by path every file outside the directory and every *other*
  file. This is the list Phase 2 copies from, so the operator consents to exactly what is about to be
  copied out of their filesystem.
- Whether `--sort-existing <dir>` is in play, and its resolved directory.
- The `docs grounding:` line in the form `workflows-core:docs-grounding`
  resolved — `ON <root> (retrieval: …)` or `OFF (<reason>)` — verbatim, including any index-build,
  staleness, or shadowing clause it carries (off switch: --no-docs). Run
  `resolve-docs-grounding brd-intake` per `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "docs-grounding resolve-docs-grounding")` to obtain it; it runs **exactly once per
  run**, here, and Phase 3.5 consumes the cached result rather than re-resolving.

**The `/epics` consent-ordering exception does not apply to this command.** `/epics` resolves docs
grounding ahead of its `require-on-main` gates because a later stop would sit after the run's only
consent-bearing step (`commands/epics.md` Phase 2). `/brd-intake` runs no `require-on-main` gate at
all — it is the route's first command and consumes no prior phase's deliverable (Phase 0) — so
resolving here, in the ordinary confirmation step, already puts the one consent-bearing step ahead
of every write and every dispatch.

**Where the walk reached any file outside the document's own directory, ask first** — the answer
decides the set the next question is asked over:

```
choices: ["Capture all <n> from outside the folder (Recommended)", "Only the document's own folder — capture nothing outside it", "Stop"]
```

*Capture all* takes every file the walk reached, the outside ones included, and Phase 2 copies those
into `brd/source-external/`. **`<n>` counts what this answer decides and nothing else: how many
distinct files the walk reached *outside* the document's own directory** — the outside files the
second answer drops, which is not everything it drops: it also drops any inside file reachable only
through an outside one, of which there may be none, one or many, each named by path beside the
question rather than counted here (below). It is never the
size of the taken set: that set's own size is in the counts by kind
printed above, which state inside and outside separately, and the final report counts the files
actually copied beside the source. A target that resolved to no single file is in none of the three,
since nothing was reached — it is named above with its reason instead, and nowhere counted.
*Only the document's own folder* takes the files inside the directory that a chain of taken markdown
files reaches from the document, and leaves everything else `excluded` (`linked-sources.md` §7):
every outside file, and **an inside file reachable only through an outside file — directly, or
through other files that are themselves reachable only that way — which this answer drops** — it
is neither copied nor logged. Name each such file by path beside the question, because the
operator is otherwise never told. Phase 2 then logs each link a copied file makes to an excluded
file, with its one reason — `absolute path` where the target as written begins with `/`,
`outside the source directory` otherwise; by `linked-sources.md` §7 those are exactly a copied
file's links to files outside the directory. A link sitting inside an excluded file is not logged,
because the file holding it is not copied. *Stop* ends the run with nothing written. Where nothing
lies outside the directory, this question is not asked, and every file the walk reached is taken.

**Where the taken set holds an *other* file — neither markdown nor an image — ask next, and put the
reason beside the question**, because this is the one array in this command whose recommended option
ends the run: such a file is copied and never read — Phase 2.5 reads images and Phase 3 markdown,
and no later command of the route opens it — so an obligation stated inside it enters the
folder unseen and stays there, and converting it first is the one check that catches that.
**Taking the recommendation therefore costs this run**: it ends having written nothing, and the
operator who means to capture today answers *Proceed*, whose substance is recorded. Say both where
the question is put, not only here.

```
choices: ["Stop and convert them first — this run ends here, having written nothing (Recommended)", "Proceed — none of them carries an obligation (recorded)", "Use a different key or path (you'll be prompted)"]
```

*Stop and convert* ends the run with nothing written:
`BRD_INTAKE_UNREAD_ATTACHMENTS: <k> linked file(s) are neither markdown nor an image and would be copied but never read: <paths>. Convert each (markdown for a document, PNG for a picture), check the conversion against the original, replace the link to the original, in the file that links it, with a link to the converted file, and re-run '/product-workflows:brd-intake <BRD-KEY> @<brd-file>'.`
`<k>` is how many *other* files the taken set holds, and `<paths>` names each of them.
It is an operator halt, not a plugin gap, so `emit-block` does not fire — Phase 9 makes the same call
for every Phase 0 stop. **Converting is the operator's checked step for the same reason Phase 0 step 3
refuses to convert the document**: an unchecked conversion would silently become part of the record —
which is the half of the reason above that outlives the choice, and why the marker sits where it does.
*Proceed* copies them, reads none of them, and records the answer's substance in the final report —
*none of them carries an obligation*, not the option's label — exactly as Phase 3's *"They hold no
obligation"* answer is recorded. **A typed answer** — the harness's free-text option, which no array
can decline (`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0) — **is acted on as the option it expresses**, and
recorded in the operator's own words where it is *Proceed*'s; where it expresses none of the three,
the question is asked again. It is never taken for any option by default. Where the taken set holds
no *other* file, this question is not asked.

**Then, in every case**, confirm the run:

```
choices: ["Proceed with <folder> (Recommended)", "Use a different key or path (you'll be prompted)", "Cancel"]
```

`<folder>` is the folder's **name**, as Phase 0 step 7 resolved or derived it and the first bullet
above shows it — `BRD-<BRD-KEY>-<slug>` for a new one — never its path.

---

## Phase 1.5 — Classify + model routing

Invoke the `model-routing` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "workflows-core:model-routing"`), then record:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: MODERATE        # typical; SIGNIFICANT for an unusually long or heavily-conflicting BRD
  reason: <one-line>
  current_model: <the model this orchestrator is running under>
  detection_model: <§2.1 Sonnet chain: claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6/4-5>   # docs-grounder (Phase 3.5)
  extraction_model: <§2 Opus chain>   # figure-reader (Phase 2.5) and brd-reader (Phase 3) — both frontmatter-pinned to opus; recorded, no override
  authoring_model: <= current_model>   # Phase 1's confirmation and Phase 4's interactive defect classification (session model, not a delegated subagent)
  opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
  notes: <any §2/§2.1 fallback or degradation>
```

`figure-reader` and `brd-reader` run on Opus regardless of `classification`, per their own frontmatter
pins. A misread label, a missed annotation or an unproposed conflict yields no candidate, so Phase 4's
human never sees it — the tier is bought where a miss is silent. If no Opus resolves, **degrade to
best-available + record** in `notes` and the final report — do not hard-block.

**Collect `figure-reader`'s and `brd-reader`'s own `notes` too, and report them** — in the final report, and `brd-reader`'s at Phase 4's start as well, the last read's where a re-read replaced the first (Phase 3) — an image too low in resolution for its small text, an unusually structured source, a passage that could not be confidently split, an observation the agent made and did not propose as a defect. The inventory is the spine every later command walks, so a `[BR#n]` split out of a passage the reader was unsure of must not read as confidently extracted.

## Phase 2 — Copy the source

**First, key the folder.** Where `<BRD-dir>` holds no `brd/brd-inventory.md` — always so for a
folder Phase 0 derived — write that file before anything else lands there, as the inventory holding
no row `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2 fixes: the frontmatter §2.1 fixes for a
source-owning BRD, `kind: brd` and `key: <BRD-KEY>` between `---` lines, then the title line and the
table's header, and **no row**. Creating the BRD folder and writing this header are one act, because
`workflows-core:addressing` §4 requires a folder never to be keyless, and nothing at a root BRD's
top level names a folder kind — the ledger Phase 5 writes there names its own document
(`coverage-ledger-format.md` §2) — so §4 reads the pair off this file. Phase 3 fills in the rows.
Until it does the inventory holds its header and no row, and it can stay that way — a run that
stops before Phase 3 writes, a Phase 3 `NOT_FOUND` stop and a completed first intake whose read was
`EMPTY` all leave it so — and a re-run takes any such inventory for no prior inventory at all
(Phase 3). A folder whose inventory already stands is left as it is here.

**Then, over an inventory written before 3.7.0, record its document before anything is copied.**
Where `brd/brd-inventory.md` holds a row and carries no `document:`, write `document:` into it now,
naming the document its rows were last reconciled against exactly as
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1.1 tells a reader of such an inventory to name it
— off the opening line of `brd/brd-link-log.md`, the log this phase is about to rewrite; by that
section's rules for a log written before its layout was fixed and for a BRD with no log, one of
which counts the markdown files under `brd/source/` and so must run before this phase copies one
there; and, where none of them settles it, by asking the operator which file it is, never by
choosing. Write it as `brd-format.md` §2 writes it, `source/<basename>` as a double-quoted YAML
string, by adding that one line to the frontmatter after `key:` and changing nothing else in the
file: `kind: brd` and `key:` stand as they were, so `workflows-core:addressing` §4 reads the
folder's kind and key off it as before, and the file is edited in place, never removed, so the
folder is never keyless (above). Write no `captured:` map — nothing on file holds the hashes the
rows were reconciled at — so the state below still takes the path for an inventory with none. **This
is why every reader has the record**: the log is rewritten below, and after a run that stops before
Phase 3 it names the document this run copied, which no row was read from, while the inventory names
the one they were read from. An inventory holding no row, or one already carrying `document:`, is
left as it stands here.

Then copy `@<brd-file>` **verbatim, byte-for-byte** into `<BRD-dir>/brd/source/<basename>` (creating
`brd/source/` inside the folder) — on a re-run, only as the copy rule below allows. Per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1, nothing under
`brd/source/` is ever edited, reworded, or reformatted, no matter how badly worded a requirement
inside it is — defects found in it are logged beside it (Phase 4), never corrected in it — and this
phase is its only writer.

**On a re-run, record each file's state before copying anything.** Phase 3's reconciliation keeps a
row's wording wherever the file its anchor points into is unchanged, and takes the new read's
wording only where it was replaced — **unchanged since the inventory's rows were last reconciled**,
which is not the same as unchanged since the last copy: a run that stopped after this phase, or a
read that found no requirement (Phase 3's `EMPTY`), can have replaced a copy with nothing reconciled
against it. So the state is judged against the record the inventory itself carries, its
`document:` and its `captured:` map (`brd-format.md` §2), never against the copy on disk. Compute
the SHA-256 of each file this run takes — under `brd/source/` and `brd/source-external/` alike — and
record it:
- **unchanged** → the map holds that hash at the file's path relative to `brd/`;
- **replaced** → the map holds another hash there;
- **new** → the map holds no entry for it.

**The document is judged against the document the rows were last reconciled against, whatever either
is called**: the inventory's `document:` names that one, and the document's entry is the map's entry
for the file `document:` names — never an entry found through `brd/brd-link-log.md`, which every run
of this phase rewrites, so a run that stopped after this phase would leave the log naming a document
no row was reconciled against. The document is **unchanged** where its hash is that entry's, and
**replaced** wherever it differs, whatever its name — never new. So a revised document the customer
sent under a new filename is recorded **replaced** — its rows take the new read's wording and each
change is reported (Phase 3) — rather than keeping the old document's text over a document that no
longer says it, and it still is on a later run where the run that first copied it stopped before
Phase 3. **Where the inventory holds rows and carries no `captured:` map** — one written
before 3.7.0, carrying at most the `document:` this phase, or an earlier 3.7.0 run's, wrote above —
nothing records the hashes its rows were reconciled against, so every file whose copy already
stands, and the document whatever its name, is recorded **replaced**, once: Phase 3 writes both
records, and every later run judges against them. Where the inventory holds no row, no state is read
(Phase 3 numbers as on a first intake). Name every file recorded replaced in the final report, and
say where one is so for want of a record rather than because its bytes changed — and where one is so
although the copy at its destination already has its bytes, because an earlier run copied it and
reconciled no row against it (it stopped before Phase 3, or its read found no requirement), so the
operator is not left wondering why a file this run wrote nothing to is called replaced.

**Then copy, writing only what differs from the copy at the destination.** Where a copy with
identical bytes already stands there, write nothing: the file counts as copied wherever this command
says a file was copied, as a file collision rule 1 re-uses does (below). Where a copy with different
bytes stands there, replace it whole — `brd-format.md` §1: a re-run over a revised source is the one
time a copy is written again, and git keeps the earlier one. Where none stands, copy the file as on a
first intake. **A document revised under a new filename is copied at that name**, and the earlier
document's copy stays where it is, since nothing under `brd/source/` is removed (`brd-format.md`
§1.1). A slice's inventory resolves its document anchors against the document its `source:` names
(`brd-format.md` §2.1), so name each slice under this BRD — found by the positive `brd-link.md`
parent test (`commands/brd-split.md` Phase 0 step 9) — whose `source:` names a document other than
the one this run copies — the earlier one the inventory's `document:` records, or one before it —
in the final report: its rows keep resolving against that kept copy, and any re-cut of it is
`/product-workflows:brd-split`'s, since this command never writes a slice (Phase 0 step 7).
`brd/source-external/` is never replaced — collision rule 1 re-uses an identical file and rules 2–3
give a changed one a new name beside the old (`brd-format.md` §1.1) — so a file there is unchanged
against its map entry wherever it has one.

**Then copy the files the source document links, byte-for-byte too** — this phase captures both, and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1.1 is the authority on what the result holds. A
customer's BRD routinely carries screenshots, diagrams and appendices beside it, and `brd/source/`,
with `brd/source-external/`, is the immutable record every `[BR#n]` anchors into: whatever this
phase does not capture stays outside that record until the document is intaken again, because
nothing but this phase ever writes under either. Copying the text alone leaves every one of those
links resolving to nothing while the run reports a faithful verbatim copy.

**The links were found, resolved and walked in Phase 1**, by `linked-sources.md` — this phase copies
what Phase 1 took and never walks again. The walk's record says, per target, what kind of file it
reached and whether it lies inside the document's own directory; Phase 1's answers say which are taken.
It copies the taken files in the order the walk reached them (`linked-sources.md` §4), and that order
is what every later mention of *Phase 2's capture order* means.

**Where each taken file lands.**

- **Inside the document's own directory** → at **its path relative to that directory** under
  `<BRD-dir>/brd/source/`, creating intermediate directories as needed. The copied document sits at
  `brd/source/<basename>` and the copy mirrors the source tree's own layout beneath it, so every
  relative link to a file inside the directory resolves from the copy exactly as it did from the
  customer's original — **with no edit to the copied text**. `../images/flow.png` written in
  `appendix/notes.md` resolves inside the directory and is copied like any other; a syntactic `..`
  test would have refused a file in scope.
- **Outside it** — taken only on Phase 1's *Capture all* → into `<BRD-dir>/brd/source-external/`, at
  its **basename**, never at a path mirroring where it came from;
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §1.1 says why. Apply
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/idea-format.md` *The collision rule*'s rule 1 to every file
  copied into `brd/source-external/`, with that directory as the destination — not only where its
  name is already taken: rule 1 compares the bytes against every file already there, so a renamed
  but byte-identical file is reused rather than copied as a twin. Where rule 1 finds no identical
  file and the file's basename is already taken there, apply rules 2–3; otherwise the file lands at
  its basename. Its rule 4 never applies here: nothing under `brd/source-external/` is overwritten,
  and no link is rewritten — the mapping table below names the copy. A file rule 1 reuses — its
  identical bytes already on file, so nothing is written — **counts as copied** wherever this
  command says a file was copied: the link log below, every later phase that says
  "Phase 2 copied", and Phase 7's `deliverable_paths`, which must declare it. An earlier intake
  that stopped before its handoff, or declined it, left that file uncommitted, and nothing else in
  this plugin ever stages it; a declared file already committed unchanged costs nothing
  (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §2.3 step 4).

Copy each file **byte-for-byte, whatever its type** — an image, a PDF, a spreadsheet — never opened
as text, never re-encoded, never resized. Phase 0 step 3's markdown-only rule is about the *document*
the inventory anchors into; a file it links is captured as it stands. **What is read, and by whom, is
Phase 2.5's and Phase 3's** — this phase copies and reads nothing.

**Every link in a copied file whose target was not copied is named, never dropped in silence.** Write
`<BRD-dir>/brd/brd-link-log.md` in the layout `brd-format.md` §1.1 fixes, its cells written by §2.3's
encoding — the frontmatter, the opening line naming the source document's basename, the counts line
(its `files copied` leaving the document out), and one row per such link carrying the target as
written, the copied file the link sits in, and exactly one of these reasons. A link sitting inside a
file that was not copied has no row (Phase 1):

| Reason | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `outside the source directory` | Phase 1's answer was *Only the document's own folder*, the walk record reads `inside: false`, and the target as written does not begin with `/` |
| `absolute path` | Phase 1's answer was *Only the document's own folder*, the walk record reads `inside: false`, and the target as written begins with `/` |
| `url` | the target carries a URI scheme |
| `unreadable` | the target resolves to no readable file (`linked-sources.md` §3) |
| `ambiguous` | a `[[wikilink]]` matched more than one file in the vault; the row's *Candidates* cell names every candidate by its path relative to the vault root the walk searched (`linked-sources.md` §3), never by the absolute path the walk record carries (`brd-format.md` §1.1) |

**Then map every captured link that does not resolve as written**, in the log's second table,
*Captured links that do not resolve as written* — columns `Target as written | Linked from | Copy` —
one row per link whose copy cannot be reached by reading its target as a path relative to the file it
sits in — the rule and its cases are `brd-format.md` §1.1's (a link to a file copied into
`source-external/`, a `[[wikilink]]`, an absolute path, a link inside a `source-external/` file whose
target lies inside the document's own folder). `Copy` is the copy's path relative to `brd/`. The
table is written, with a header and no rows, even where nothing needs mapping.

**Write the log on every run, including one that captured everything** — its counts are then the
positive record that the capture ran, which an absent log and an empty one are not. Report the same
counts and the same list, each entry with its reason, in the final report.

---

## Phase 2.5 — Read the figures

**Every image Phase 2 copied is read here or, where its bytes are unchanged, re-used — and there is
no cap on how many.** A cap would leave an image's obligations outside the record exactly as not
reading it did (`brd-format.md` §1.2).

1. **Re-use before reading.** Compute each copied image's SHA-256. Where
   `<BRD-dir>/brd/brd-figures.md` already holds a section for that image whose *Content hash* matches,
   keep that section's transcription — the lines `brd-format.md` §1.2 names — **verbatim** and do not
   dispatch the image — a writer preserves what it did not produce, as
   `workflows-core:grounding-format` §6.2 has an index writer do with a row. On a first intake there
   is no file and nothing is re-used. **A section recording `Read: no` is re-used on that same test
   and not re-dispatched**: the hash matched, so the bytes are the ones that could not be read, and
   a retry spends a dispatch on a failure that will repeat — the reason `/workflows-core:frames`
   does not retry a frame its describer could not read either. Such a section therefore counts under
   `reused` and never again under `not read` (`brd-format.md` §1.2, which counts a re-used section
   there whatever its *Read* line says), which is why the final report names every captured image
   holding no transcription with its recorded reason rather than leaving the counts line to say it.
2. **Dispatch `figure-reader` over the rest**, at most 10 images per dispatch and at most 4 dispatches
   in a single response, in further waves until none remain:

   → Agent (subagent_type: "product-workflows:figure-reader", model: `<extraction_model — frontmatter-pinned to opus>`):
     > "figures: [absolute path of each image's copy under `<BRD-dir>/brd/` in this batch, in Phase 2's capture order]"

   **Each path is the copy Phase 2 made, never the original** — the copy is what a section describes
   and the file whose content hash step 1 compares.

   An `INPUT_MISSING` return is this run's defect — it sent an empty batch — and is fixed and
   re-dispatched, never recorded as an unread image.
3. **Write `<BRD-dir>/brd/brd-figures.md`** per `brd-format.md` §1.2: one section per image Phase 2
   copied, in capture order — re-used transcriptions verbatim, new ones from the agent's return in
   the *Text*, *Annotations* and *Flow* forms §1.2 fixes, an image returned `read: false` with its
   reason and no transcription. Write *Linked from* afresh for every image Phase 2 copied, re-used
   or not, from the files Phase 1's walk found linking it — **each named by the path of the copy
   Phase 2 made of it, relative to `brd/`**. The walk ran over the customer's **originals**,
   read-only and before any copy existed (Phase 1), so no copy carries a record of it: map each
   linking original the walk recorded onto its own copy rather than looking for the link again in
   the copies. Write each passage by its heading path
   in `brd-format.md` §2.2's form, a file's title left out, or by its line range where it has none
   (§1.2). Write the counts line as §1.2 defines its terms — a re-used section counted under
   `reused`, never under `read`. **Every section already on file whose image this run did not take
   stays** — a section is never deleted — and carries the *Not captured by the current run* marker
   `brd-format.md` §1.2 fixes, whatever the cause — for instance the current document no longer
   links the image, this run's Phase 1 answer left it out, or a changed outside image was copied
   beside it under a `_NN` name; a section whose image this run takes again carries none. **Leave
   each existing section's *Rows* line as it stood, and give a new section an empty one** — written
   `- **Rows:**`, with nothing after it, as `brd-format.md` §1.2 fixes — Phase 5 overwrites every
   one of them from the final inventory, so a run that stops before Phase 5 leaves each earlier line
   on disk as it was, and each new one empty. An `EMPTY` read over an earlier intake's inventory
   keeps each line, and Phase 5 writes it back unchanged.

**Where the folder holds no figures file and Phase 2 copied no image**, this phase dispatches
nothing, writes no file, and says so in the final report. **Where a figures file is already on file
and Phase 2 copied no image** — a revised document with its screenshots removed, or a re-run whose
Phase 1 answer left out images an earlier intake captured — it dispatches nothing and still runs
step 3 over the sections on file, so every one of them carries that marker. Phase 3, Phase 5 and
Phase 7 test whether the figures file **exists after this phase**, written or updated by it, and
never whether this run copied an image.

---

## Phase 3 — Extract the inventory

**Hand `brd-reader` the figures file without its *Rows* lines.** Where a figures file exists after
Phase 2.5, write a copy of it with every section's `- **Rows:**` line removed and nothing else
changed, as `brd-figures.md` in a directory `command mktemp -d` creates — never inside a repository
or the specs tree — and hand over that copy. A *Rows* line is this command's bookkeeping, not what
the image shows, and on a section re-used from an earlier run it names that run's `[BR#n]`s: handed
over, they come back as the agent's own numbering, and the mapping below would then send each onto a
different row. The copy is made on a first intake too, where every line is empty, so every read is
handed the same shape. Remove the directory once this phase's last read has returned. Then dispatch:

→ Agent (subagent_type: "product-workflows:brd-reader", model: `<extraction_model — frontmatter-pinned to opus>`):
  > "source_path: [absolute path to the copied document at `<BRD-dir>/brd/source/<basename>`]
  >  appendices:  [absolute path of every linked markdown file Phase 2 copied — under `brd/source/` or `brd/source-external/` — in Phase 2's capture order; `[]` when none]
  >  figures_path: [absolute path to that copy of `<BRD-dir>/brd/brd-figures.md`, its *Rows* lines removed; omit when no figures file exists after Phase 2.5]"

Act on `status`:
- **`OK`** — **hold what the read returned, and write nothing to the inventory yet**: the rows, each
  row's candidates, the `figures` entries with their `illustrates`, and the `notes` are this read's,
  and the coverage step below can replace every one of them with a re-read's and add a row from a
  sentence the operator quotes. **Whatever that step leaves is the standing read's: the last read
  whose result was not discarded, an `EMPTY` re-read discarding its own** (below) — this read where
  no re-read ran, or where one ran and returned `EMPTY`; the re-read where its result replaced this
  read's. **This phase writes, and the phases below carry, the standing read's rows, candidates,
  `figures` entries and `notes`** — that read, and never simply the latest one dispatched, which
  after an `EMPTY` re-read is the read whose result was thrown away; every mention of *the standing
  read* below names it. **Once that step has settled — or just before the stop its relation 1
  makes — write the rows** of `<BRD-dir>/brd/brd-inventory.md` in the layout
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2 fixes, below the frontmatter, title and table
  header — Phase 2's, or on a re-run the file's own, rewritten in that layout where an earlier
  release wrote another (§2.3): one row per `[BR#n]` as the steps below settle it (`id`, `text`,
  `source_anchor`), each cell written by §2.3's encoding — the agent returns the customer's text as
  it stands, line breaks and `|` included, and this run encodes it. **Write the frontmatter's
  `document:`, `captured:` map and `accounts:` map with the rows** (`brd-format.md` §2): `document:`
  naming the document this run read, `source/<basename>`; the `captured:` map holding every file
  this run captured, at the SHA-256 of its copy under `brd/`, and every entry already on file for a
  file this run did not capture, kept as it stands; and the `accounts:` map holding the account of
  every section and image the coverage step recorded or carried (below), and every entry already on
  file for an item in a file this run did not capture, kept as it stands — **less every entry for an
  item in a file Phase 2 recorded replaced that this run did not ask afresh**, the drop
  `brd-format.md` §2 makes on every write of the map. **Write the `quoted:` list with them**
  (`brd-format.md` §2): every `[BR#n]` already on that list, kept, plus the id of each row the
  coverage step minted from a quoted span this run — nothing is ever dropped from it, and a row it
  names that this read did return is left on it all the same. They are what the next run judges the
  document, each file and each account against, and what tells it which rows no read ever
  returned, so all four are written wherever this branch
  writes the rows, and nowhere else — save Phase 2's one write of `document:` alone into an
  inventory written before 3.7.0, which this write replaces.

  **On a first intake, number in reading order, once** — after this branch's last read and after
  any row the coverage step adds, as `brd-format.md` §2 fixes; where it adds none, that is exactly
  as the standing read returned them. Until then each row carries the read's own number, which the
  mapping below turns into its id once the numbering is fixed. **On a re-run over a folder whose
  inventory already holds a row, RECONCILE — this is the id coordination `brd-reader` delegates and
  nothing else performs.**
  The agent numbers in source order from `BR#1` on every read, so a BRD v2 with one requirement inserted
  early returns a set in which every later id has shifted by one. Writing that straight through
  renumbers text that already has an id, which `references/brd-format.md` forbids outright (*"assigned
  once, never renumbered"*, and *"re-extraction would mint a second set of ids for text that already has
  them"*). Nothing downstream would notice: every `[CG#n]` premise, every `[DEF#n]` target, every
  child's copied inventory and `claims:` list cites `[BR#n]` **by id**, and `/brd-split`'s reconcile
  unions claimed rows by id too — so a shift silently re-attaches each claim to a different requirement,
  and no gate reads a `[BR#n]` against the text it names.

  So: read the existing `brd/brd-inventory.md` first, every cell decoded
  (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2.3). Match each returned row to an existing
  row in two passes, each existing row matched at most once:

  1. **By anchor.** Two anchors match where they name the same section or element by
     `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2.2's rules — a section as the branch that
     resolves the anchor finds it, so a heading path written with a file's title, before that
     section fixed the title-less form, still matches the same path without it; an image element
     as §2.2 fixes which element an image anchor names, so `annotation 2` matches a quote of
     annotation 2's *Says* — and, by §2.2's rule for comparing two image anchors, two anchors on
     one image quoting the identical string match even where that string names no single element,
     since a row drawn from an image is the plugin's own words and is reworded between reads.
     Where exactly one existing row and exactly one returned row share a section, an element or
     such a quote, they match. **Where several share it on either side** — the rows one split
     produced (§2), or several requirements stated in one section — match among them by text alone,
     by the next pass's test, and never by position: a row of the group the text pairs with nothing
     is left for pass 2.
  2. **By text.** A returned row pass 1 left unmatched matches an existing row not yet matched whose
     `text` is the same, compared after decoding, after the split-shape rewrite below, and after
     collapsing every run of whitespace — a decoded `<br>` included — to one space and trimming both
     ends. Nothing else is normalised: a changed word is a different text.

  **A split row an earlier release wrote in another shape is compared in the fixed one.** Before
  3.7.0 fixed `<lead-in> … <item>` (`brd-format.md` §2), a split row's `text` held its lead-in, then
  one or more line breaks — with or without a line holding an ellipsis alone among them, written
  `…`, `[…]` or `...` — then its item, often behind a list marker (`-`, `*`, `+`, or a number and
  `.`). Before either pass compares two texts, rewrite each side whose decoded text has that shape —
  exactly two lines that are neither blank nor such an ellipsis line, the lead-in and the item — into
  `<lead-in> … <item>`, the marker dropped, so a row on file from an earlier release matches the text
  the new read returns for it. The rewrite is the comparison's alone: nothing is written in that
  form because of it. **A lead-in or an item that itself spans more than one line leaves more than
  two such lines, and is not rewritten**: no rule can tell where its lead-in ends, so the row stays
  unmatched by text, and the same-or-new question below shows it beside a returned row under its
  anchor wherever that question applies.

  **A matched row keeps the id it already has**, whatever the agent returned for it — **and keeps
  its existing `source_anchor` where that one resolves (`brd-format.md` §2.2) and the returned one
  does not**, so an anchor the operator corrected by hand survives the re-read that follows the
  correction (relation 1 below). **Where both resolve and they differ, neither is taken silently:
  the pair goes to the same-or-new question below and the operator settles it.** §2.2 matches two
  anchors that name one element without their text being the same — `annotation 2` against a unique
  quote of annotation 2's *Says*, or a longer quote of the same *Text* region — so a matched pair
  whose anchors differ is reachable, and a moved row and a re-anchored one look alike from here:
  the read may have found the same requirement at a neighbouring element, or a different one.
  *Same requirement* keeps the pair matched and keeps the existing `source_anchor` with it;
  *A new requirement* unmatches the pair, so the returned row is minted and the existing row is kept
  as one nothing matched (below). **For a pair the anchors send there, that question settles the
  anchor and whether the two are one requirement — never the text**, which follows the rule below
  either way: on a file Phase 2 recorded **replaced**, *Same requirement* keeps the id, takes the
  returned `text` and reports the change old → new, because the question was never asked about a
  wording the revised document no longer carries. **Its `text` turns on whether the file its anchor
  points into changed** — the file the matched anchors name, as Phase 2 recorded it:
  - **replaced** — the document included where it came under a new filename (Phase 2): the row
    takes the returned `text`, and where the two differ after decoding and whitespace collapse the
    run reports the change, old → new, with the row's `[BR#n]`;
  - **anything else** — Phase 2 recorded the file **unchanged** against the inventory's `captured:`
    map, which a file under `brd/source-external/` always is where the map holds it, since a copy
    there is never replaced; or **new**: the row **keeps its existing `text`**. An unchanged source
    cannot have changed what the requirement says, so a read that words it differently is the
    agent's paraphrase, not a revision, and writing it through would change a row every later
    command reads by id with nothing to show that it moved.
  A row matched by text in pass 2 keeps its existing `text`: the two are the same text.

  **A re-read (below) is reconciled exactly as the first read was — against the inventory on file,
  never against the first read's rows, which it replaces.** It reads the very bytes the first read
  read — nothing is copied between the two — so every file stands for it as Phase 2 recorded it,
  unchanged since the first read, and this text rule and the same-or-new question below apply to it
  as they did to the first: a row it words differently keeps its id and its text over an unchanged
  file, and can never be minted beside a row the first read returned, since that read's rows are
  gone. Only what the re-read returns is reconciled, so each question below is put about its rows,
  afresh.

  **Then put to the operator what the two passes cannot decide.** Where a returned row is still
  unmatched, Phase 2 recorded the file its anchor points into **unchanged**, and its anchor names the
  same section or element as one or more existing rows neither pass matched (pass 1's test, a quote
  naming no single element counting as naming every element that holds it, `brd-format.md` §2.2),
  the source cannot have gained a requirement there since those rows were reconciled — the read has
  most likely worded, or cut, one of them differently. **It is put as well for each pair pass 1
  matched whose two anchors both resolve and differ** (above), that row shown beside the one row it
  matched. Ask, one question per such returned row, in the
  order returned, with its text shown beside the text of **every one of those existing rows** still
  unmatched when the question is put, each by its `[BR#n]`, lowest-numbered first, each decoded:

  ```
  choices: ["Same requirement as [BR#n] (Recommended)", "A new requirement", "Cancel"]
  ```

  `[BR#n]` is the lowest-numbered of them. *Same requirement* matches the two as pass 2 would: the
  row keeps its id, its anchor and its existing `text` — **stated for the unmatched-row case this
  question was written for, where the file is recorded unchanged** (above), so keeping the text is
  what the text rule gives anyway. **For a pair the differing anchors sent here it keeps the id and
  the existing anchor, and the text rule settles the text** — the returned one on a replaced file,
  reported old → new. *A new requirement* leaves the returned row to
  be minted (below) and every existing row shown for the next question under that anchor. **A typed
  answer** — the harness's free-text option (`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0) — giving the
  `[BR#n]` of another row shown matches that one instead, exactly as *Same requirement* would; one
  naming a row not shown, or expressing none of these, is asked again, and none is taken by default.
  *Cancel* ends the run before this phase writes anything, so the inventory on file stands with its
  `document:`, `captured:` map, `accounts:` map and `quoted:` list, and a re-run judges the document
  and every file against the same record and keeps naming the same rows as quoted. An existing row no answer matched stays unmatched and is kept as below,
  in the words its own state there gives it — its anchor resolves, so *not re-extracted by this
  read*, save a `quoted:` row, which is reported apart from those (below).

  **Only a returned row that matches nothing existing is new**, and it takes the next id after the
  highest already in use — never a gap-filling reuse of a retired one. A row the coverage step adds
  from a sentence the operator quotes is new too, and takes the next id after those, in reading
  order (`brd-format.md` §2).

  **An existing row nothing matched is never renumbered away, and which of two states it is in is
  read off its own anchor** — never off the agent's silence, which says only that this read did not
  return it. The first state is reported in one of two ways, settled by whether the row is one the
  operator quoted; the second in one:
  - **its anchor still resolves** by `brd-format.md` §2.2 against what this run captured — on an
    unchanged file, the ordinary case — so what it names is still there, and this read merely did
    not extract it: the row is **kept whole** — `text`, `source_anchor` and `defects` — and reported
    as *not re-extracted by this read*, naming its file where Phase 2 recorded that file replaced;
    relation 1 below tests it like any other row. **Except a row the inventory's `quoted:` list
    names** (`brd-format.md` §2), which is kept the same way and reported in its own words —
    *added from a quoted span; this read did not return it* — a claim about this read and never
    about every read before it, since a change to what the agent is handed — a revised document, a
    transcription `/product-workflows:brd-reconcile` corrected (`brd-format.md` §1.2) — can make it
    start returning such a row and a later read stop again, which is a genuine drop this wording
    keeps visible. The coverage step minted it precisely because `brd-reader` did not return it,
    and **where nothing it is handed has changed it will not return it on a later run either**, so
    not being returned is the ordinary case here rather than news; reporting it in the other words would leave a row the agent genuinely stopped
    returning indistinguishable from the one the run itself created. Only rows off that list are reported *not re-extracted by
    this read*, and a `quoted:` row a read **did** return is not in either state — it matched, and
    is nothing to report;
  - **its anchor no longer resolves** — the revised source no longer carries what it named, or the
    markdown file it names is not in this run's capture: the row is kept whole too, id retained, and
    reported as a row *this source no longer contains*; relation 1 below passes over it.
    **An image anchor is never in this state for want of a capture.** `brd-format.md` §1.2 keeps the
    whole section of an image the run did not take — its marker, its *Read* line, its hash and its
    transcription — and §2.2 resolves an image anchor against the transcription of any image the
    figures file records as read, so such a row resolves and belongs in the first state above,
    reported *not re-extracted by this read*. It is the same section Phase 5 writes
    `yields [BR#n]` on in this same run, which is the reading that would otherwise be contradicted.

  Report the reconciliation: how many ids were preserved; **every id minted, by `[BR#n]` with its
  text** — a count alone would hide a requirement read twice under two ids; each text change (old →
  new); each row kept, in the words its own state above gives it, the quoted rows named apart from
  the rest — **and where one of those two classes is empty, say so**, since a class with no members
  printed looks exactly like a class the run never looked at, which is the whole reason the two are
  worded apart; and each answer to the question above, by `[BR#n]`.

  **An inventory holding no row is no prior inventory, whatever left it so** — Phase 2's header,
  whether a run stopped before this phase wrote a row, stopped at this phase's `NOT_FOUND`, or
  completed a first intake whose read was `EMPTY`: a run over it numbers as a first intake does,
  and every first-intake rule of this phase applies to it, since it holds no id to keep.

  **Map every `[BR#n]` the agent returned through that reconciliation — on a first intake, through
  the numbering above, fixed once the coverage step has settled — wherever it appears in what the run
  writes or reports from the agent's words** — not only the row ids, but each candidate's
  `names` and every id its free-text `reason` cites, each `figures` entry's `illustrates` and every
  id its `note` cites, and every id in the agent's `notes` — bracketed or bare (`BR#8`). The agent
  numbers its own read from `BR#1`; a `conflict` naming its `BR#7`, an image said to illustrate its
  `BR#7`, or a reason saying a flow is *"inventoried in words as BR#6, BR#7 and BR#8"*, means
  whatever rows the reconciliation matched to those numbers, and writing the agent's numbers through
  would attach the candidate, the image or a confirmed defect's own reason to a different
  requirement. The one exception is a span that quotes the customer verbatim, which is never
  rewritten.

  **On a first intake, leave each row's `defects` column empty for now** — it is filled in Phase 4,
  once a candidate is actually confirmed into a `[DEF#n]`, never before. **On a re-run, give each row
  that kept its id the `defects` it carries on file**, and nothing more yet: a `[DEF#n]` is
  permanent (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §4), Phase 4 keeps every entry already
  logged, and it adds only what it newly confirms. Carry the standing read's `defect_candidates`
  forward into Phase 4 — a re-read's replace the first read's wholesale, save an `EMPTY` re-read's,
  which replace nothing, as its `figures` entries and its `notes` do (below) — and nothing here
  treats a candidate as a decision.

  **Then check the inventory's coverage of its own source**, per
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §2.2, before anything downstream treats the
  inventory as the spine it is. The three relations read the anchors the steps above settled — held,
  not yet written — the copied document and linked markdown, `brd/brd-figures.md`, and the `figures`
  list the agent returned; the account question below reads one record more, the inventory's
  `accounts:` map on file, and the agent is re-dispatched only where that question's set question
  is answered *Re-read*.

  1. **Every `source_anchor` resolves**, in whichever of `brd-format.md` §2's three forms it takes —
     by the rules `brd-format.md` §2.2 fixes for each form, which this command applies and does not
     restate. **Except the rows the reconciliation above kept as rows *this source no longer
     contains*** — kept whole, id retained and reported, because the anchor no longer resolves
     against this run's capture: it points into a section the revised document dropped, or into a
     file this run did not take. That is a recorded state, not an untraceable one, and stopping on it
     would hard-stop a supported path — a customer sending a revised BRD — with a remedy nobody can
     perform, since correcting the anchor by hand is impossible when the content it named is gone.
     Exclude them by the reconciliation's own list and name them in the report instead. A row kept
     as *not re-extracted by this read* is not among them, and neither is one kept as *added from a
     quoted span*: each one's anchor resolves, and each is tested like any other row.

     Any **other** unresolvable anchor is named with its `[BR#n]`, and the run stops — a row nobody
     can trace back is a defect in the artifact whose job is traceability. **Write the rows this
     branch holds first**, as the write above writes them — on a first intake numbered as the read
     returned them, since no row has been added yet, and with the `accounts:` map on file kept but
     for the drop every write of it makes, every entry for an item in a file Phase 2 recorded replaced
     (`brd-format.md` §2), since this `captured:` map records those files' new bytes and no account
     has been asked yet, and with the `quoted:` list on file kept whole — this stop is taken before
     the coverage step, so no quote has been given to add to it and nothing is ever dropped from it
     (`brd-format.md` §2) — because the remedy is a hand correction in that file, which a stop that
     wrote nothing would leave nobody able to make:
     `BRD_INTAKE_DANGLING_ANCHOR: <N> inventory row(s) carry a source_anchor that resolves to nothing in the copied source under brd/ (<BR-id>: <anchor>, …), and none of them is a row this run preserved as no longer present. The row cannot be traced back to the customer's document, which is the one thing the anchor exists for. Correct each anchor by hand in <path> and re-run '/product-workflows:brd-intake <BRD-KEY> @<brd-file>': the re-run keeps every id, and keeps a corrected anchor that resolves.`
  2. **Every top-level section — of the document and of each linked markdown file Phase 2 copied —
     either holds a row or is accounted for.** `brd-format.md` §2.2 fixes what a top-level section
     is — where one heading titles a file, the sections at the shallowest level beneath the title —
     and what holds one: an anchor naming it or a section beneath it, or a link in it to an image or
     a captured markdown file that yields a row; it counts a linked file with no heading as one
     section. Name each section that holds none, by its heading path in §2.2's form, with what the
     source has under it.
  3. **Every image Phase 2 copied yields a row, illustrates one, or is accounted for**
     (`brd-format.md` §2.2). Name each image that does neither — with its *Depicts* sentence from
     `brd/brd-figures.md`, or its reason where it was not read.

  **Where relation 2 or 3 names anything, account for it — re-reading is an action on the whole
  set, accounting is per section and per image.** First set aside what is accounted for on file:
  each section or image whose key the inventory's `accounts:` map holds (`brd-format.md` §2), where
  Phase 2 recorded its file **unchanged** — the file a section sits in, the document judged against
  `document:`, or the image itself. Such an item's account is **carried** as it stands, and it is not
  asked about again; an item in a file recorded **replaced** has its entry dropped and is asked about
  afresh — §2's carry rule and drop, read off the map alone: an image's *Rows* line shows an account
  and is never read back as one. Where nothing is left, nothing is asked. Otherwise put one question
  for the whole set, naming each item — a section by its heading path, with what the source has
  under it; an image by its path, with its *Depicts* sentence, or its reason where it was not read:

```
choices: ["Re-read — re-dispatch brd-reader over the whole set and reconcile<recommended>", "Account for each section and image<recommended>", "Cancel"]
```

  **It is put once per run, because a re-read is allowed once per run.** *Re-read* re-dispatches
  `brd-reader` with the same inputs — it takes the whole set, the document, every linked markdown
  file Phase 2 copied and the figures copy, and numbers from `BR#1` on every read, so there is no
  narrower re-dispatch — and **the re-read's result replaces this read's wholesale**: its rows, its
  candidates, its `figures` entries with their `illustrates`, and its `notes`, the first read's
  kept nowhere. Act on its `status` as on the first read's, **save `EMPTY`, which replaces
  nothing**: a read of the same set that finds no requirement has not shown the first read's rows
  gone, so the first read's result stands, the run says so, and the re-read is spent — what the
  first read left unaccounted for goes straight to the per-item questions below. On `OK`, run this
  branch again over the re-read from the top — the numbering or the reconciliation, the id mapping,
  the `defects` column and this check — with this question left out, so whatever it leaves
  unaccounted for goes straight to the per-item questions too. *Account for each section and image*
  goes straight to them. *Cancel* ends the run before this phase writes anything, as the
  same-or-new question's does. **A typed answer** — the harness's free-text option, which no array
  can decline (`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0) — is acted on as the option it expresses: a
  re-read, accounting item by item, or *Cancel*. Anything else is asked again, and no answer is
  ever taken for an option by default.

  **A re-read does nothing for what `brd-reader` is never handed**, so it returns the same result
  for: an image that was not read — the agent reads a transcription and never the picture, and an
  unread image has none — and a section whose every sentence hangs on a link to a file the agent is
  never handed. **Apply that to the section's own text, never to what its words are for.** Take the
  section as the source writes it, the sections beneath it included and its own heading line left
  out, and cut it at each sentence end — a `.`, `?` or `!` followed by whitespace or by the end of
  the text — and at the end of each list item, table row and heading. The section is one a re-read
  cannot change **when every piece so cut holds at least one link or embed whose target the agent
  was not handed**: an *other* file whatever Phase 1's answer; an image `brd/brd-figures.md` records
  as not read, which has no transcription to hand over; or a link the copy did not capture —
  a URL, an unreadable or `ambiguous` target, or a file Phase 1's answer left out, each named in
  `brd/brd-link-log.md`. One piece carrying no such link is prose the agent was handed, and a
  re-read can change the section. **Where the cut cannot be made confidently, treat the section as
  one a re-read can change**: the cost of that default is one dispatch that returns what it
  returned before, and the cost of the other is an account standing where a requirement would have
  been. Where **the set question above** names an item a re-read cannot change, say so beside **that
  question** — never beside the per-item questions below, which also name an item and ask something
  else: it is settled
  by accounting for it, or by converting or capturing the file and re-running this intake.

  **`<recommended>` is a placeholder this run resolves once** — substitution, not an edit to the
  array, which is otherwise presented verbatim; `workflows-core:escalation-rules`, *The
  `(Recommended)` marker is unconditional*, sanctions exactly this. Where any item the question
  names is one a re-read can change, it resolves to ` (Recommended)` on the first option and the
  empty string on the second. Where every one it names is of the kind above, it resolves to the
  empty string on the first and ` (Recommended — a re-read returns the same result for every one
  named)` on the second: a re-read that cannot change the result spends a dispatch on nothing.

  **Then each item still unaccounted for gets a question of its own**, sections in reading order
  (`brd-format.md` §2) and then images in Phase 2's capture order, at most four to an
  `AskUserQuestion` call — more than four go out in several calls, each item still its own
  question. **Within a call the arrays go out together and everything after them is one item at a
  time, in the call's order**: where two or more of them answer *Quote…*, the plain-text asks are
  not batched — the first item is taken to its end (a span written as a row and its question
  returned in the third form, a failed span re-putting its own question, another quote, *Finished*)
  before the second item's ask is put at all. A re-put question and a third-form question each go
  out on their own, never beside another item's, so no operator answers one item's question next to
  a form of another that their own last answer has already moved on. The next call's arrays go out
  once every item of this one has finished. Each names its item as the set question did:

```
choices: ["They hold no obligation — record that (Recommended)", "Quote the sentence that binds (you'll be prompted)", "Cancel"]
```

  An image that was not read has no transcription to quote from, so its question leaves the second
  option out:

```
choices: ["They hold no obligation — record that (Recommended)", "Cancel"]
```

  Once the item holds a row a quote added, its question takes a third form, the rows it holds shown
  under it, each by its text:

```
choices: ["Finished with this item — the rows shown are all it binds (Recommended)", "Quote another sentence that binds (you'll be prompted)", "Cancel"]
```

  - ***They hold no obligation*** records the item's account in the answer's substance, never the
    option's label — *they hold no obligation*.
  - ***Quote the sentence that binds***, and ***Quote another***, ask in plain text for one span
    stating **one** obligation — a sentence, or the clause of one that states it — and show beside
    the ask what the span is checked against: the section's own text as the source writes it, the
    sections beneath it included, or the image's transcription, element by element
    (`brd-format.md` §2.2). **One obligation to a quote**: where a passage binds two, each is quoted
    in turn, since one span carrying both would be one row with two obligations, which
    `brd-format.md` §2's splitting rule forbids. The span is checked once every run of whitespace on
    both sides is collapsed to one space and both ends are trimmed — the comparison pass 2 makes,
    and nothing else normalised. **A span that is empty once collapsed and trimmed — an answer of
    whitespace, or of nothing — is a span that does not occur**, whatever it is checked against: the
    empty string is a span of every text and would anchor a row on content it has nothing to do with
    (`brd-format.md` §2.2, which refuses an empty image anchor outright). It takes the failed-span
    branch below like any other. **Where it occurs** — anywhere in the section, or within an element
    of the image — and repeats no span the item has already given a row, the run adds a row: its
    `text` the matched span as the source writes it, or as the transcription gives it, never as the
    operator typed it; its `source_anchor` in `brd-format.md` §2's form — for a section, the
    section's heading path, a linked file's path and ` › ` before it, where that path names exactly
    one heading in its file (§2.2 branch 2), and otherwise, or in a file with no heading, the line
    range the span covers, `L<first>-L<last>`, with a linked file's path and ` › ` before it; for an
    image, `<its path relative to brd/> › "<the matched span as the transcription gives it>"`, a
    span found in more than one element written all the same, as `brd-reader` writes one where no
    span is its element's alone (§2.2 compares such an anchor); no defect candidate, since
    `brd-reader` proposed none; and its place in reading order at that section, or where §2 places
    a row drawn from that image — **among the item's own rows, the source order of the spans they
    quote**, which is the order the spans occur in the section's text, or in the image's
    transcription element by element, whatever order the operator quoted them in: §2's reading order
    fixes where the item's rows sit among other items', and this fixes where they sit among each
    other, which §2 leaves open because an item's rows can share one anchor. **On a first intake,
    say what that placing costs the numbering — after the item's *Finished* answer, never as each
    row is added**: ids are fixed once, after this step, in reading order (`brd-format.md` §2), so a
    span quoted from a passage early in the document takes an id one of the read's own rows would
    have had and moves every later one down. Said as each row went in, the sentence would be
    falsified by the item's next quote out of source order, which moves the same rows again — and
    *Finished* is the first moment the run knows there is no next quote, the third-form array being
    where the operator says so, so it is said after that answer and not between a row and the
    question that follows it. **The
    operator has seen no `[BR#n]` at all on a first intake** — none is printed anywhere before
    Phase 4 — so what they are told is not that a numbering they read has changed, but that the ids
    they will meet are not the order they quoted in. Nothing is renumbered twice and no id on file
    moves, a first intake
    holding none; on a re-run the question does not arise, since a row added there takes the next
    id after the highest in use (above). Its id goes on the
    inventory's `quoted:` list (`brd-format.md` §2), which is what stops every later run reporting
    it as a row this read failed to re-extract: where nothing `brd-reader` is handed has changed it
    will not return it then either, having not returned it now; where a change to what it is handed
    — a revised source, a corrected transcription — does make it start being returned, the row
    simply matches like any other and there is nothing to report. From then on it is a
    row like any other — numbered or minted as above, open to a candidate Phase 3.5 raises and to
    Phase 4's walk of it, and written to the ledger by Phase 5 — and the item's question comes back
    in its third form.
  - **An unlabelled mark is named by its position instead of quoted**, and the quote prompt accepts
    that answer on an image item. `brd-format.md` §1.2 writes such a mark's *Says* as `""`, which
    says the mark carries no label and is no string to quote, and §2.2 refuses an empty image anchor
    outright — so an image whose binding content is an unlabelled mark has nothing the rule above
    can match, and without this the operator is left with *They hold no obligation*, which is false,
    or *Cancel*. The prompt therefore also takes an answer naming an annotation by its position in
    the image's *Annotations* table, `annotation <n>`, and shows the table beside the ask as it
    shows the transcription. It is taken where that table has an n-th row **and** that row's *Says*
    is `""`; where the row's *Says* carries a label, ask again for the label's own words, which are
    quotable and which §2.2 prefers; where the table has no such row, it takes the failed-span
    branch below like any other answer. The row is added exactly as a quoted span's is, save two
    fields: its `source_anchor` is `<the image's path relative to brd/> › annotation <n>`, the one
    form that reaches a mark with nothing to quote (`brd-format.md` §2.2, `agents/brd-reader.md`
    step 4), and its `text` is that row's *Points at* as the transcription gives it, the transcription
    holding nothing else about a mark that carries no words. It is placed among the item's rows at
    that annotation's own position, in the same element-by-element order through the transcription
    that a quoted span's row is placed by. An answer naming an annotation the item has already given
    a row takes the failed-span branch too, for the reason that branch gives. Like a quoted span's
    row it goes on the inventory's `quoted:` list.
  - ***Finished*** records nothing more: the item holds its rows, so no account is recorded for it,
    and those rows are its whole record.
  - **A span that does not occur, or repeats one the item has already given a row, is never written
    through** — a row holding it would be an obligation the customer never stated. Put the item's
    own question again, in the form it stands at — the first while it holds no row, the third once
    it holds one — with the failed span shown beside it and why it failed, so that form's own way
    out stays in reach beside *Cancel*: *They hold no obligation* in the first, *Finished* in the
    third. A span the operator cannot make match — markdown they did not retype, a sentence running
    across a table's cells — is never a dead end.
  - **A typed answer** — the harness's free-text option, which no array can decline
    (`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0) — is acted on as the option it expresses: a span is taken
    as a quote and checked as above; words to the effect that the item holds no obligation, where it
    holds no row, are recorded as its account, in the operator's own words; words to the effect that
    it is finished, where it holds one, finish it; a *Cancel* cancels. Anything else is asked again,
    and no answer is ever taken for an option by default.
  - ***Cancel*** ends the run before this phase writes anything.

  **Record every account for the write**, carried and new alike, in the inventory's `accounts:` map
  (above; `brd-format.md` §2) — a section's and an image's alike, an image's shown on its *Rows*
  line by Phase 5. **Report the outcome either way** — each account by its section or image and its
  words, saying which were asked and which carried from file, each row a quote added, and whether a
  re-read ran and what it returned — including "every top-level section and every image accounted
  for": an unreported clean result is indistinguishable from an unrun check. **Where no anchor parses
  at all, say that and stop**: that is a read failure, not a document with no coverage.
- **`EMPTY`** — report that the source contained no identifiable requirement, and skip Phase 4
  (nothing to classify). **What the run leaves turns on whether the folder already holds an
  inventory row:**
  - **No prior inventory** — a first intake, or an inventory holding its header and no row. In
    Phase 5, leave `brd/brd-inventory.md` as its header alone — never an empty file, which would
    leave the folder keyless (Phase 2) — write `brd/brd-defect-log.md` as its header alone where
    none is on file, so the file Phase 7 declares exists, and write `coverage-ledger.md` as its
    header alone (`brd-format.md` §2, §4; `coverage-ledger-format.md` §2); the final report's ledger
    line reads
    `ledger: 0 requirements — 0 covered, 0 deferred, 0 rejected, 0 unallocated, 0 unresolved (0 delegated, 0 not built)`.
    **Say plainly, here and in the final report, that the route stops on this BRD until the
    inventory has a row.** `/brd-split` has nothing to carve, and it stops with
    `BRD_SPLIT_EMPTY_INVENTORY` rather than reporting a quiet success; `/prd-ground` and
    `/brd-interview` refuse a root outright (`PRD_GROUND_ROOT_LEVEL`, `BRD_INTERVIEW_ROOT_LEVEL`),
    so no slice exists for them to run on. Phase 8 offers the one thing that changes it — re-running
    this command over this same folder with a source whose requirements `brd-reader` can identify —
    and does **not** offer grounding, because offering a command that would refuse this BRD is worse
    than offering nothing. Carry the `EMPTY` result forward to Phase 8 as the flag that picks its
    choice list.
  - **An inventory an earlier intake filled** — keep it **exactly as it stands**, its `document:`,
    `captured:` map, `accounts:` map and `quoted:` list included, and the defect log and the ledger
    with it: nothing is renumbered, re-minted or rewritten. A read that returned nothing has not shown that any
    requirement is gone — the reconciliation above tells a row *this source no longer contains* from
    one *not re-extracted by this read* by the row's own anchor, and an empty read never reaches that test —
    so no row is reported in either state, and the next re-run with a readable source reconciles
    against the ids on file rather than numbering from `[BR#1]` over a defect log whose entries cite
    them. Because those records stand too, that re-run judges the document and each file against the
    same record, so a file recorded **replaced** here is recorded so again and the rows it matches
    there take the new wording (Phase 2). Report the read as empty, name the document this run read
    and every file Phase 2 recorded **replaced**, into which a kept row may anchor, and say that
    every row, defect and disposition stands as it was. The final report's ledger line is the
    ledger's own as it stands — which a `/brd-split` walk may have given `covered-by` rows, so it is
    computed as `coverage-ledger-format.md` §6 fixes, each such row resolved one hop through the BRD
    it names (Final report). Phase 8 branches on whether any of its rows is still `unallocated`.
- **`NOT_FOUND`** — surface the agent's exact message and stop; this should not occur (Phase 0
  confirmed the document is markdown, Phase 1's walk classified every appendix as markdown, and
  every path handed over is a file Phase 2 copied or the copy of Phase 2.5's figures file this
  phase wrote), so treat its appearance as worth investigating rather than retrying blindly.

---

## Phase 3.5 — Documentation grounding (optional)

Consume the `resolve-docs-grounding brd-intake` result cached in Phase 1 — never re-run it. When
`docs_grounding: OFF`, skip silently and say so once in the final report. When `docs_grounding: ON`,
`dispatch-docs-grounder` (`workflows-core:docs-grounding`) with
`feature_summary` = two to four sentences drawn from the Phase 3 inventory (what this BRD asks the
product to do, in the operator's own product terms), `key` = `<BRD-KEY>`, and `themes` = the
capability themes the inventory rows cluster into. This runs after Phase 3 because the inventory is
what the summary is built from, and before Phase 4 because Phase 4 is where the digest is consumed.

**Consumption is grill-rank (`workflows-core:docs-grounding`), against the Phase 4 defect walk — and a
`[DEF#n]` is the only thing documentation can ever put on a `[BR#n]` row.** Two effects, both of
them landing on the row only through Phase 4's existing human confirmation:

- **Ranking.** Rank each `docs_challenges` entry into the order Phase 4 puts candidates to the
  operator, so a candidate a shipped page bears on is asked earlier. Ranking never adds a question
  and never removes one — the walk still visits every candidate `brd-reader` returned.
- **Raising.** A `docs_challenges` entry may be *raised* as an additional defect candidate, but only
  in the two classes documentation can actually speak to
  (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §3): `unsourced`, when the requirement asserts
  current system behaviour a shipped page corroborates or contradicts — the page is what makes the
  assertion worth grounding, never what settles it; and `ambiguity`, when the BRD uses a term the
  shipped documentation uses for something else, so two competent readers would implement it
  differently. A raised candidate is walked, confirmed, and numbered exactly like one `brd-reader`
  returned, and a rejected one is dropped the same way.

**`docs_references` — what the product already ships and documents — is reported, never written.**
It is genuinely useful here: a requirement the
docs describe as already shipped is one `/prd-ground` should check against code first. But it is
not a defect and it has no field on an inventory or ledger row, so it goes into the final report and
nowhere else. Nothing docs-derived is ever written into `evidence` — that column stays empty until
grounding runs (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §2), and grounding
does not accept a document as evidence either (`commands/prd-ground.md` Phase 4.5).

---

## Phase 4 — Confirm defects

**This is the human-in-the-loop step `brd-reader` cannot do itself.** Every `defect_candidates`
entry the agent returned is a hypothesis, never a decision (`agents/brd-reader.md`) — confirming or
rejecting each one, against the customer or the delivery team, is this phase's job alone.

**First, print `brd-reader`'s `notes` — once, at this phase's start, whether or not any candidate
is left to walk** (Phase 1.5 collects them): the standing read's, as Phase 3's `OK` branch fixes
which read that is, with every `[BR#n]` in them mapped as Phase 3 maps one — through its
reconciliation on a re-run, through its numbering on a first intake. An observation
the agent made and did not propose — a possible conflict it would not assert, say — belongs in front
of the person confirming defects, and on a run whose every candidate matched an entry on file it
still has to be seen. **The walk cannot turn a note into a defect**: every question it asks confirms
or rejects a candidate, and a `[DEF#n]` is minted from a confirmed candidate only, so a note stays a
note. **Nothing parses a note either** — it is printed, never read into a field: Phase 5 writes a
*Rows* line from the returned `illustrates` alone, whatever a note says of it
(`agents/brd-reader.md`: a note never amends a returned field). The notes are carried to the final
report, named, and never dropped; after an `EMPTY` read, which skips this phase, the final report is
where they are printed.

**On a re-run over a folder whose defect log already holds entries, match before asking** — a
`[DEF#n]` is permanent (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §4), and a re-extraction
proposes the defects already logged all over again. Read `brd/brd-defect-log.md` first, and take
every row in the test below as Phase 3's reconciliation numbered it.

- **An `ambiguity`, `untestable`, `unsourced` or `scope-leak` candidate matches** an entry on file
  of its class raised on the same row. Where several candidates or several entries share one class
  and row, pair them in order — the entries by id, the candidates as returned — and treat whatever
  is left over on either side as unmatched. **The order decides which pairs, not which is the same
  defect**, so a candidate left over is walked with every entry on file of its class and row shown
  beside it (the *On file* line below), and the question says that where it restates one of them,
  *Reject — not a defect* is the answer: that entry already is the defect, and confirming the
  candidate would log it twice.
- **A `conflict` or a `duplicate` is matched on the rows its relation joins, in either direction**,
  never on which row raised it: the same split or clash can be raised from the whole, naming each
  part, or from each part, naming the whole. Such a candidate joins its row to each counterpart it
  names, and it matches where every one of those pairs is already joined, by some entry on file of
  its class raised from either end — those entries are what it matches. One some but not all of
  whose pairs are joined is walked with each entry on file of its class joining any of them shown
  beside it (the *On file* line below), and **confirmed, it records only the pairs no entry on file
  joins**: each joined pair is a defect on file already, so recording the whole candidate would log
  it twice, while *Reject — not a defect* would drop the pairs nothing on file joins. Its question
  names both sets, so the operator answers for the pairs a confirmation records and for no other.

**A match is that entry, or those entries**: the candidate is not put to the operator again, and
nothing is written for it — each entry keeps its `[DEF#n]`, its reason and its resolution exactly as
on file — so a defect `/brd-reconcile` resolved stays resolved, and a defect already put to the
customer keeps the id its held question names and is not asked twice. **An entry is not re-raised
only where no candidate of this read carries it, matched or not** — for an `ambiguity`,
`untestable`, `unsourced` or `scope-leak` entry, where no candidate of its class is raised on its
row, so an entry the pairing order left over still counts as re-raised wherever a candidate of its
class and row was proposed; for a `conflict` or a `duplicate`, where no pair it joins is joined by a
candidate of its class — **an entry counts as re-raised wherever any pair it joins is**, so one a
candidate matched is never also reported not re-raised: a split an earlier release logged three
ways, each entry joining two pairs, is matched by the one candidate a current read proposes, and
none of the three is not re-raised. Such an entry is kept exactly as it stands and reported as *not
re-raised by this extraction*: its id stays in the log, and every row that cited it keeps citing it
(Phase 3 carried those ids over), since a read that did not propose it again has not shown the
defect gone. **A `conflict` or `duplicate` entry some of whose pairs a candidate of its class joins
and some of which none joins stays re-raised**, and is kept exactly as it stands as well; the report
names it with each pair no candidate joined beside it — a report only, on which nothing is asked or
written. Only an unmatched candidate is walked below — including one an earlier run rejected, which
left no entry to match and so is put again.

**Then join this read's own candidates the same way, before walking any.** `brd-reader` raises each
`conflict` or `duplicate` from one end (`brd-format.md` §3); a read that raises one from both ends
anyway, or raises one relation among three or more rows as several candidates each naming some of
the others, would otherwise put one clash to the operator more than once and log it as several
defects, on a first intake as on a re-run. So among the candidates left to walk, **group** those of
one class that share a pair of rows — joined in either direction — directly or through another
candidate of the group. A group of one is walked as it stands. A group of two or more is one
relation and is walked as **one** candidate: raised on the row `brd-format.md` §3 raises that
relation on — the whole, for a `duplicate` in which one row is a part of another; the first row a
split produced, for a split's (`brd-format.md` §2); the lowest-numbered row the group joins, for a
restatement `duplicate` or a `conflict` — and naming every other row the group joins. Its reason,
and its place in every order below, are those of the group's candidate raised on that row, or,
where none is, of the candidate `brd-format.md` §4's numbering order puts first; every other
candidate of the group is **folded** into it and not walked, its reason carried on the *Also
raised* line below, so one answer decides the group. The report names each folded candidate beside
the one walked in its place. **The candidate a group of two or more is walked as is then matched
against the log on file as the bullets above match one**, since its pairs — its row with each other
row the group joins — need not be any of its members' pairs: where entries on file of its class join
every one of them, it is a match like any other and is not walked, and where they join some, it is
walked as such a candidate is.

Group the candidates to walk by class — every carried-forward candidate on a first intake, the
unmatched ones on a re-run, less any folded above; `brd-reader`'s, plus any Phase 3.5 raised from
documentation, which are walked identically and marked in the report as docs-raised — and walk them
**one class at a time**, in the fixed order `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brd-format.md` §3
lists its six classes. Within a class, take the candidates in the order Phase 3.5's ranking gives
them, and otherwise in the inventory order of the row each is raised on, and confirm each
individually via `AskUserQuestion`. **A split is one candidate, confirmed once**: `brd-reader`
proposes the one `duplicate` a split records on the first row it produced (`brd-format.md` §2), so
the walk never asks about each part.

**The question's text is fixed, so every candidate reaches the operator with the same facts**, each
`[BR#n]` in it as Phase 3 numbered it (by its reconciliation on a re-run, by its numbering on a
first intake), each row's text decoded (`brd-format.md` §2.3):

```text
<class> on [BR#n] — "<the row's text>" (<its source_anchor>)
Reason: <the candidate's reason>
Names: [BR#m] — "<that row's text>", …
Image: <its path relative to brd/> — <its Depicts sentence>; open the image before answering.
Element: <the element the row's anchor names, verbatim, by the kind it is>
Also raised: [BR#m] — <that folded candidate's reason>, …
On file: [DEF#k] — <that entry's reason> (<its resolution>), … — if this candidate is one of these, answer "Reject — not a defect".
On file: [DEF#k] — <that entry's reason> (<its resolution>), joining [BR#a] and [BR#b], … — logged already; confirming records only [BR#n] with [BR#m], …, the pairs none of these joins, so answer for those pairs alone.
```

The *Names* line is written for a `conflict` or `duplicate` only, one entry per counterpart the
candidate names — for a group walked as one, every other row the group joins; the *Image* and
*Element* lines only for a row drawn from an image (below); the *Also raised* line only for a
candidate another was folded into, one item per folded candidate, naming the row it was raised on;
the *On file* line only
where an entry on file bears on the candidate, one item per such entry — in its first form for an
`ambiguity`, `untestable`, `unsourced` or `scope-leak` candidate the pairing above left over, each
entry on file of its class raised on its row; in its second for a `conflict` or `duplicate`, each
entry on file of its class joining any pair of rows the candidate joins (for a group walked as one,
the group's pairs), since a candidate some of whose pairs the log already joins is walked all the
same — each item naming the pairs of those rows it joins, and the line ending with the candidate's
own pairs, its row with each counterpart it names, that no entry on file joins: the pairs a
confirmation records (above); a candidate Phase 3.5
raised from documentation ends its first line with `(raised from documentation)`.
Then present:

```
choices: ["Confirm as written (Recommended)", "Confirm with an edited reason", "Reject — not a defect", "Cancel"]
```

**A candidate on a row drawn from an image is put with its picture.** Show the image's path relative
to `brd/`, the *Depicts* sentence of its section in `brd/brd-figures.md`, and the part of that
section's transcription the row's anchor names — `brd-format.md` §2.2 fixes which element that is:
the *Text* region or cell holding the quote, written as the *Text* fence gives it; the annotation's
row, its *Says* and what it *Points at*; or the *Flow* edge, as its item reads. Where the quote names
no single element, show every element holding it, each by its kind. Show nothing else of the
transcription, and tell the operator to open the image before answering: the transcription is the
plugin's reading of the customer's picture (`brd-format.md` §1.2), and the picture is what the
candidate is about.

On confirmation, the candidate is **confirmed** — with its reason as written, or as the operator
edited it — and waits for its id. On rejection, the candidate is simply dropped — it never becomes a
`[DEF#n]`, so nothing further records that it was proposed.

When every class has been walked, **assign ids to the confirmed candidates in the one order
`brd-format.md` §4 fixes** — the inventory order of the row each is raised on, then §3's class order
within that row, then the order `brd-reader` returned them in, and after them those raised from
documentation, in the order `docs-grounder` returned them — from `[DEF#1]` on a first intake, and on
a re-run after the highest id the log on file holds (ids are permanent, §4). Never number in the
order the walk put the questions, which Phase 3.5's ranking moves. Then write
`<BRD-dir>/brd/brd-defect-log.md` in the layout `brd-format.md` §4 fixes, its cells written by
§2.3's encoding: **every entry already on file, matched or not, kept exactly as it stands** — its
id, class, rows, reason and resolution, carried into this layout where an earlier release wrote the
log in another (§2.3), the first row a pre-layout entry was recorded against becoming its
`raised on` and any other its `names` (§4) — then one entry per newly confirmed `[DEF#n]` — its
class, the one row it was raised on, the counterparts a `conflict` or `duplicate` names (carried
straight from the candidate walked — for a group, every other row it joins — less each counterpart
whose pair with that row an entry on file already joins, as the matching above records it), its
reason, and resolution `open` (none of the other three resolutions has happened to it yet). Then update
`brd/brd-inventory.md`'s `defects` column with each newly confirmed `[DEF#n]` **on the row it was
raised on, and on that row only** — a counterpart row does not list it, since the entry names it
(`brd-format.md` §4) — beside the ids Phase 3 carried over.

---

## Phase 5 — Write the coverage ledger

Write `<BRD-dir>/coverage-ledger.md` in the layout
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §2 fixes: one row per `[BR#n]` from the
(now defect-annotated) inventory — `id`, `text`, `defects` mirrored from the inventory, each cell
copied as it stands there (`brd-format.md` §2.3), `evidence` empty (grounding has not run yet — that
is `/prd-ground`'s job), and **`disposition: unallocated` on every row**, per §3: "the initial
state; the only one of the six that blocks §4." No row is ever written in any other disposition
here. After an `EMPTY` read, Phase 3 says what this phase writes: the ledger's header alone where
there was no prior inventory, and nothing where an earlier intake's inventory stands.

**Then complete `brd/brd-figures.md`'s *Rows* line for every image**, from the final inventory —
after Phase 3's id mapping (its reconciliation on a re-run, its numbering on a first intake), never
from the agent's own numbering: `yields` every row
whose `source_anchor` names the image and `illustrates` every row the standing read's `figures`
entry for it returns in `illustrates` — the read Phase 3's `OK` branch fixes, so where a re-read
found no requirement it is the first read's entry, that re-read having replaced nothing —
**written from that field alone**: a `brd-reader` note is printed
(Phase 4) and never parsed, so a note saying the list is wrong changes nothing here, and the agent
corrects a field in the field (`agents/brd-reader.md`) — either half left out where its list is
empty (`yields [BR#3]`), or, where it does neither, the value `accounted for — <its account>` in the
form `brd-format.md` §1.2 fixes, the account being the image's entry in the `accounts:` map Phase 3
wrote — asked this run or carried (`brd-format.md` §2) — and never one read back off the line on
file; after an `EMPTY` read, which asks
no question, what `brd-format.md` §1.2 fixes for that case — over an
earlier intake's inventory, each section's line exactly as Phase 2.5 left it on file, `illustrates`
included, since that read keeps every row it names, and `none — no requirement extracted` for a
section that had none; over a folder holding no prior inventory row, `none — no requirement
extracted`. A section carrying the *Not captured by the current run* marker `brd-format.md` §1.2
fixes gets no agent entry and no Phase 3 answer: its *Linked from* and *Rows* take the values §1.2
fixes for such a section. Where no figures file exists after Phase 2.5, this is
skipped.

**On a re-run this phase rewrites every disposition, and it does so unconditionally by design** —
save after an `EMPTY` read over an earlier intake's inventory, which re-extracted nothing and so
rewrites nothing (Phase 3). Where Phase 0 step 7 resolved an **existing** folder, the ledger that
folder holds is replaced row for row: every `covered-by`, `deferred-to`, `rejected` and
`superseded-by` `/product-workflows:brd-split`'s walk wrote is gone, and so is any illegal root
`covered-here`. **The warning and the confirmation for that are step 7's**, taken before Phase 2
copied anything, because by the time this phase runs a revised file's copy has been replaced and the
inventory re-extracted and there is no state left to decline into. What this phase owes is the
restatement: report which dispositions this write discarded, how many of each, and that they must be
re-taken in `/product-workflows:brd-split`'s walk. A rewrite the operator consented to at step 7 is
still a rewrite the run has to name.

---

## Phase 6 — Migrate existing work (`--sort-existing <dir>`, optional)

Only when `--sort-existing <dir>` was given (Phase 0/1). Read the hand-written package at `<dir>`
and sort its sections **by altitude** — product-level content (what / why / for-whom) into
`<BRD-dir>/prd-seed.md`, architecture-level content into `<BRD-dir>/ard-seed.md`, and
implementation-level content into `<BRD-dir>/spec-seed.md`.

**These land on the BRD root, and every consumer resolves a slice — so say where they are.** `<BRD-dir>`
is always a root `BRD-` container (Phase 0 step 7 stops on a slice with `BRD_INTAKE_SLICE`, and on
an Epic or any other folder that is not a BRD with `BRD_INTAKE_EPIC_LEVEL` or `BRD_INTAKE_NOT_A_BRD`), while
`/create-prd`, `/create-ard` and `/specify` each refuse a `BRD-` container before reading anything,
and each looks for its seed in the resolved `PRD-` slice first and, only where the slice holds none,
in the parent BRD folder its `brd-link.md` names — which is how a seed written here is read at all.
Slices do not exist yet at intake time, so the seeds cannot be written into them here, and this run
must not pretend otherwise: **name the three paths in the run's output and state that a later slice
consumer reads them from this folder, one level up from itself, wherever the slice holds no seed of
its own.** An operator who looks for them in a slice finds nothing there, and without that line would
take the migration's output for lost.

State plainly in the run's output that
this is **the migration path for work already done by hand**, before this workflow existed — and
that it **writes seeds only, never findings**: no `[CG#n]`/`[DG#n]` grounding, no ledger
disposition, comes out of this phase. Those are `/prd-ground`'s and `/brd-split`'s to produce, once
grounding has actually run. When `--sort-existing` was not given, this phase is skipped silently.

---

## Phase 7 — Handoff

Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff")` and present its §4.3 choice array verbatim — the **advisory** array: `/product-workflows:brd-split` on a root reads this
handoff's artifacts with a plain worktree read at its own step 8, never a `require-on-main` gate
(steps 6 and 7 run only in `split_mode: allocate-only`), so nothing downstream gates any of them any
more:

```
choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git (no command stops on this; what reads it reads your working copy)", "Cancel"]
```

On the first choice, execute `handoff-to-main` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "phase-handoff handoff-to-main")`, §2) with `prefix: brd`, `feature_folder` as resolved in Phase 0, `deliverable_paths` = **every file under
`<BRD-dir>` this run captured or wrote** — a file counting as captured whether this run copied its
bytes or found an identical copy already standing, which covers both collision rule 1's re-use and a
re-run that left an unchanged copy untouched (Phase 2), neither of which this run *wrote* — **enumerated, one literal repo-relative path each: never a glob and never a directory**, because §2.3 stages neither, so a declaration that looks complete ships nothing — §2.3 step 4 names each in §4.1's *declaration unaccounted for* clause, so the failure is reported rather than silent, but nothing it names lands. That is the customer's document and every file Phase 2 captured into `brd/source/` or `brd/source-external/`, whether or not this run wrote any of them — named individually (the copy step knows them; neither `brd/source/**` nor `brd/source-external/**` is a path), plus `brd/brd-inventory.md`, `brd/brd-defect-log.md`, `brd/brd-link-log.md`, `brd/brd-figures.md` wherever it exists after Phase 2.5,
`coverage-ledger.md`, and — only when Phase 6 ran — `prd-seed.md`, `ard-seed.md`, `spec-seed.md`.
**Declare, too, every untracked file already under `brd/source/` or `brd/source-external/` that this
run did not take** — one an earlier intake copied and never handed off, or copied before it was
interrupted — found by `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" status --porcelain -z --untracked-files=all` over those
two directories and named one literal path each: nothing else in the plugin ever stages it, so
undeclared it stays untracked and the specs-repo preflight reports it as an unrelated dirty path
(`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §3.3 G1) on every later run),
`title: <BRD-KEY> Intake BRD source and requirement inventory`, and `body_facts` = the requirement
count, the confirmed-defect count by class, and whether Phase 6 wrote seeds; emit its §4.1 outcome
line in the final report.

**On the second or third choice `handoff-to-main` does not run, and the final report still carries
an outcome line**: §4.1's *Declined by the user* row, its `<artifacts>` the `deliverable_paths` set
above as that row counts it, and its `<next-phase-clause>` the **advisory** one, which is what the
array's parenthetical promised (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.1, §4.3). Either way the run goes
on to Phase 8 and Phase 9's emitter tail.

`brd` is the branch prefix `workflows-core:phase-handoff` §2.9's `prefix` row lists as shared by
every `/brd-*` command and, on the BRD route, `/prd-ground` (the way that row shares `prd` among the
producers it names) — a BRD is neither a PRD nor any other prefix §1 rule 3 there lists, and
reusing `prd` would collide with the `prd/<SLICE-KEY>-<slug>`
branch `/create-prd` on the BRD route opens once a slice of this BRD is PRD-eligible. **That
switch ships**, so the collision is live rather than hypothetical: that command's handoff derives
`prd/<SLICE-KEY>-<slug>` from a slice folder nested inside the very folder this run wrote into,
exactly as `/product-workflows:create-ard` and `/product-workflows:specify` on the BRD route derive
`ard/<SLICE-KEY>-<slug>` and `spec/<SLICE-KEY>-<slug>` from it on a PRD-level run — an Epic-level
run under a slice derives `ard/<EPIC>-<eslug>` or `spec/<EPIC>-<eslug>` from the `EPIC-` subfolder
instead, a branch that collides with nothing here either. Keeping `brd`
separate is what lets all four branches exist on one key without either family renaming anything —
and this command's own `<BRD-KEY>` never carries the other three, because **the folder it creates is
a container**: a PRD, an ARD and a specification are authored in the `PRD-` slices under it, one
each, and all three commands refuse the container itself
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §5).

---

## Phase 8 — Next steps

**Branch on the inventory and the ledger this run leaves.** A BRD whose inventory holds no `[BR#n]`
row is refused by every downstream command on the route, and `/product-workflows:brd-split`'s walk
takes only a ledger's `unallocated` rows (`coverage-ledger-format.md` §4), so offering either where
there is nothing for it would name a run that stops on its own Phase 0 or does nothing — the offer
`workflows-core:next-phase-offer` exists to prevent. **Its sibling re-cut does walk rows with a
fate** — on a root whose every row is allocated, given an instruction
(`coverage-ledger-format.md` §3.2) — and is not offered either: it moves a row only where the slice
holding it has recorded in its own ledger that it will not build it, which this command never reads,
and nothing this run did bears on that — it writes no slice, and wherever it rewrites this ledger it
leaves no row allocated.

**One or more `[BR#n]` rows, at least one still `unallocated` — the ordinary case, since this run
writes every row `unallocated` wherever it writes the ledger's rows, and an `EMPTY` read over an
earlier intake's inventory whose ledger still holds such a row (Phase 3):**

```
choices: ["Carve slices — /product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY> \"<how to cut it>\" (Recommended)", "Stop here"]
```

`<BRD-KEY>` is substituted; **`<how to cut it>` is printed as it stands**, a placeholder the operator
replaces with their own slicing instruction when they type the command. `/brd-split` refuses a root
that still has rows to place without one (`BRD_SPLIT_NEEDS_INSTRUCTION`), and this run has no
instruction to put there: filling it in would put words in the operator's mouth about how their
customer's requirements divide. Say so beside the list.

**Rows on file and none `unallocated` — an `EMPTY` read over an earlier intake's inventory whose
ledger `/product-workflows:brd-split` has already walked (Phase 3) — carving is left out**, since
every row keeps the fate that walk gave it and a bare `/brd-split` over this ledger moves nothing:

```
choices: ["Re-run this intake with a corrected source — /product-workflows:brd-intake <BRD-KEY> @<brd-file>", "Stop here — every row keeps the disposition it had"]
```

Neither option carries a `(Recommended)` marker, for the reason the zero-row list below gives:
whether the read came back empty because of the source is a judgement about the customer's document.
Say beside the list which document this run read, and that a re-run whose read finds a requirement
replaces every disposition with `unallocated` — Phase 0 step 7 names each one before anything is
copied.

**Zero `[BR#n]` rows (a Phase 3 `EMPTY` read over a folder holding no prior inventory row) —
`/product-workflows:brd-split` is left out rather than offered and refused:**

```
choices: ["Re-run this intake with a corrected source — /product-workflows:brd-intake <BRD-KEY> @<brd-file> (this folder is a re-run, not a refusal)", "Stop here — this document states no requirement the route can carry"]
```

Neither option on that zero-row list carries a `(Recommended)` marker, and the omission is deliberate
per the `When no option is safe to recommend` guidance in
`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "escalation-rules")`: whether the source was mis-converted, was
the wrong file, or genuinely states no requirement is a judgement about the customer's document, and
only the operator who has read it can take it. Say beside the list which conversion or file this run
actually read, so that judgement has something to stand on.

`/product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY>` refuses this same emptiness on a root —
`BRD_SPLIT_EMPTY_INVENTORY (split_mode: full)` — which is why it is left out here rather than
offered and refused. `<BRD-KEY>` here is always a root: this command never writes a slice, and
`/product-workflows:prd-ground <BRD-KEY>` is never the fix for one — it refuses any root BRD
outright, at its own Phase 0 step 5a, with `PRD_GROUND_ROOT_LEVEL`, before it ever reaches a
merge-state gate; grounding now happens only at the slice `/brd-split` carves. **The *Carve slices*
offer carries no `<merge-clause>`**, and that is derived, not an oversight: `/brd-split` on a root
reads this handoff's artifacts with a plain worktree read at its own step 8, gating none of them, so
there is no wait to state. Guidance only — never auto-invokes another command. Per
`workflows-core:next-phase-offer`.

### Context hygiene

Per `workflows-core:session-hygiene`, the resume pointer is written in the
terminal cost phase (Phase 9), after the cost entry and before the commit step. Continuing this
route into `/product-workflows:brd-split <BRD-KEY>` — both PM — keeps the context relevant → run
**`/compact`**. Guidance only — nothing is auto-run.

## Phase 9 — Session maintenance, feedback & cost

Terminal phase — runs after Phase 8, NEVER interrupts an earlier phase.

**Capture-at-block invariant.** If an EARLIER phase **halts on a plugin / skill / command /
reference gap**, `emit-block` (per `workflows-core:feedback-emission`) at that
halt **before** escalating. None of Phase 0's stops qualify — a missing key, a missing source, a
non-markdown source, a key that resolves to a slice (`BRD_INTAKE_SLICE`), to an Epic folder
(`BRD_INTAKE_EPIC_LEVEL`) or to a folder that is not a BRD at all (`BRD_INTAKE_NOT_A_BRD`), and an
unset `$SPECS_PATH` are all environment / user halts, never a plugin
capability gap, so `emit-block` never fires from this command's own Phase 0. Nor does Phase 1's
`BRD_INTAKE_UNREAD_ATTACHMENTS`: linked files the operator must convert first are an operator halt,
as Phase 1 says where it stops.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (subagent_type: "workflows-core:impl-maintenance", model:
   `<detection_model — §2.1 Sonnet chain>`) with a compact handoff: command `/brd-intake`; what was
   produced (the copied source and the files it links, the figures transcriptions, the inventory,
   the confirmed defect log, the link log, the ledger skeleton); key events (a rejected PDF, an
   *other* file the operator accounted for, an `EMPTY` read, a link the copy did not capture, an
   `ambiguous` wikilink, an image not read, unresolved candidates left `open`, docs grounding OFF or
   a docs-raised defect — or "none"); workarounds; test result N/A; project root = the BRD folder.
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "feedback-emission emit-auto")` and call its `emit-auto` entry point (§6)
   with the Lessons Learned report, `command: /brd-intake`, the run's `key` (the `<BRD-KEY>`),
   `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`).
   Surface the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted").
3. **Session cost (ALWAYS runs).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "cost-emission emit-cost")` and call its `emit-cost` entry point with `command: /brd-intake`, `phase: brd-to-prd`, `role: pm`, the
   run's `key`, `source`, and `plugin_version`. Surface the persisted path (or the report-only
   notice).
4. **Write the resume pointer.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "session-hygiene")` and, per its §1, write/overwrite `<BRD-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` now — after the cost entry above, and before
   the commit step below. Redact per §1. Silent.
5. **Commit session artifacts (terminal).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git commit-artifacts")` and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — the LAST action of the run. It stages ONLY the §2.1 bounded artifact paths
   inside `$SPECS_PATH`, commits `<BRD-KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (/brd-intake)` with
   no `Co-Authored-By` trailer, and pushes to the branch Phase 7's handoff created. It NEVER touches
   a code repo, a docs repo, or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository; NEVER force-pushes; NEVER
   fails the run; and skips entirely when the run carries `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting
   that notice. Hold its §6 outcome line for the final report.

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits the deliverable (git for the deliverable is
offered only in Phase 7), and NEVER writes into a code/docs repo or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository;
no user name is ever written.

## Final report

Report: the BRD folder + source path; how many files were copied beside the source — inside its
directory and into `brd/source-external/` — and, per `brd/brd-link-log.md`, every link the copy did
not capture with its reason (Phase 2), with Phase 1's answers and any *other* file the operator
accounted for; on a re-run, every file Phase 2 recorded **replaced**, saying where one is so for
want of a `captured:` record, and where one is so although its copy already stood
with those bytes, because an earlier run copied it and reconciled no row against it — and each slice
whose `source:` names a document other than the one this run copied (Phase 2); how many images were
transcribed, re-used and not read, with each reason; **how many of the images this run captured hold
no transcription at all — every one it dispatched that came back `read: false`, and every section it
re-used whose *Read* line still records a failed read — each with the reason on record**, since a
re-used one counts under `reused` and appears in `not read` on no run after the first, so the counts
line alone would say a run read everything it has; and how many sections on file carry the *Not
captured by the current run* marker (Phase 2.5); how many linked markdown files were read beside the
document (Phase 3); on a re-run, the reconciliation — ids preserved, every id minted by `[BR#n]`
with its text, each text change old → new, each answer to the same-or-new question, and each row
kept — as *not re-extracted by this read*, as one *added from a quoted span; this read did not
return it*, or as one *this source no longer contains* — or, after an
`EMPTY` read over an earlier intake's inventory, that every row stands as it was (Phase 3); the
coverage outcome for sections and images — whether a re-read ran, and where it found no requirement
that the first read's result stood, each row added from a span the operator quoted, by `[BR#n]` with
its text, each quote that did not match with why, and each account as recorded, by its section or
image
and its words, saying which this run asked and which it carried from file (Phase 3); the requirement
count; the confirmed-defect count by class
(and how many candidates were rejected, how many of the confirmed ones were raised from
documentation rather than by `brd-reader`, and each candidate folded into another) — on a re-run,
also how many candidates matched an entry already on file, each entry on file *not re-raised by this
extraction*, with the rows citing it, and each `conflict` or `duplicate` entry re-raised on only
some of its pairs, with the pairs no candidate joined (Phase 4); the `docs grounding:` line from
Phase 1 verbatim, and — when it was ON — the `docs_references` list of requirements the shipped
documentation describes as already built, flagged for `/prd-ground` to check against code; whether
Phase 6 wrote seeds and which; resolved model routing (+ any Opus degradation); every agent's
`notes` — `figure-reader`'s and `brd-reader`'s, as Phase 1.5 collects them, the latter's being the
standing read's — the read Phase 3's `OK` branch fixes, or, where that branch never ran, the one
read there was — with its `[BR#n]`s mapped as Phase 3 maps one, by its reconciliation on a re-run
and by its numbering on a first intake; the feedback and cost paths;
the `Phase handoff:` outcome line (`workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.1) — `handoff-to-main`'s on the first choice, and the
*Declined by the user* line on either other (Phase 7); the `Specs repo:` outcome line from
`commit-artifacts` (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §6); the next-step recommendation; and end with
the ledger line, exactly per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coverage-ledger-format.md` §6:

```
ledger: <N> requirements — <covered> covered, <deferred> deferred, <rejected> rejected, <unallocated> unallocated, <unresolved> unresolved (<delegated> delegated, <not-built> not built)
```

`/brd-intake` writes every row `unallocated` wherever it writes the ledger's rows, so on such a run
this line reads
`ledger: <N> requirements — 0 covered, 0 deferred, 0 rejected, <N> unallocated, 0 unresolved (0 delegated, 0 not built)`;
after an `EMPTY` read it is the line Phase 3's `EMPTY` branch names, which over an earlier intake's
inventory is the ledger's own as it stands, and whose non-zero counts are those an earlier
`/brd-split` walk left.
On a run that writes the ledger's rows, the `covered-by` resolution §6 requires reads no child
ledger: no row this command writes is `covered-by`, so the delegated figures are zero by
construction rather than by omission. After an `EMPTY` read over an earlier intake's ledger the line
is that ledger's, which a `/brd-split` walk may have given `covered-by` rows, and it is computed as
§6 fixes, each such row resolved one hop through the BRD it names — a read for the report, from
which this command gains no precondition.
