"""session-cost.py — compute the token-cost delta for one dev-workflows command.

Pure computation, Python standard library only (json, argparse, glob, os,
datetime). Given a chained checkpoint (or none) it reads the current session's
main transcript from a line offset forward plus the session's subagent
transcripts within a timestamp window, accumulates token usage per model,
applies a price table (USD per MILLION tokens), and prints a structured JSON
result to stdout. It NEVER writes the specs repo and NEVER writes the checkpoint
back — the caller (references/cost-emission.md) persists ``new_checkpoint``.

Claude Code stores no dollar figure in the transcript; every assistant message
carries ``.message.usage`` + ``.message.model``, so cost is computed, not read.

    the sibling's 4000 as well: 9000 claimed where 5000 is correct, 800 left in the

    of this marketplace also ships) and a `/superpowers:implement` (a real namespace,
