# Prose style rules

This skill gives any writing agent the active prose style rules, so content comes out
correctly styled instead of being corrected afterwards.

## How to use

### 1. Resolve the active rule set

Same mechanism as `prose-style-checker` step 1, in short form. **Every miss is a silent
fall-through — never an error, never a prompt.**

**Baseline (always read):**

```
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/
```

This is also the path `/prose-style-refresh` asks this skill to resolve on its behalf,
because `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` does not expand in a slash-command body. When a caller
asks for the baseline directory, hand back this expanded absolute path. It is read-only:
nothing ever writes into it, because a plugin reinstall replaces it.

**Overlay (read the first that resolves, then stop):**

1. `<repo-root>/.prose-style/rules/` — where `<repo-root>` is
   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for the content being written, falling back to the
   working directory's repository, falling back to no overlay.
2. `$PROSE_STYLE_PATH` — an absolute path to a rules directory.
3. Nothing — the baseline alone.

A candidate resolves only when it is a readable directory holding at least one `.md`
file.

### 2. Merge

The overlay **augments and overrides** the baseline, per file name. Both are in force;
on any conflict about the same term or rule, **the overlay wins**. A term listed under
an overlay's `## Allowed` heading is not a violation. An overlay file whose first line
is `<!-- prose-style: replace -->` replaces the same-named baseline file outright. An
overlay file with a name no baseline file uses is an additional rule source.

### 3. Write

Apply the rules below while writing. The reference docs carry the full tables and
examples; this checklist is the subset that changes the most sentences.

**When the overlay and this checklist disagree, the overlay wins.** This checklist
restates the *baseline*, which an organization's overlay is entitled to override.

## Quick checklist (apply while writing)

### Terminology
- One term per concept, on every page. Never vary a term for variety.
- Write product names exactly as their owners write them: `GitHub`, `PostgreSQL`,
  `npm`, `Kubernetes`, `macOS`.
- Never pluralize or possessivize a product name — use it as an adjective.
- Lowercase a capability described in prose; capitalize only a declared mark or a
  visible UI label.
- Name the version instead of writing "new", "latest", or "currently".

### Excluded words (never use)
- blacklist → blocklist / denylist
- whitelist → allowlist / safe list
- master (tech) → primary / main
- slave → replica / secondary
- grandfathered → legacy / exempt
- native (of people) → name the specific group
- crazy, insane → unexpected / surprising
- sanity check → confidence check
- blind to → unaware of
- cripple → impair / degrade
- dummy → placeholder / sample

### Voice and tone
- **Active voice** by default: actor + verb + object.
- **Second person, present tense**: address the reader as "you".
- **Imperative for steps**: "Select **Save**." — not "You should select **Save**."
- **No hedging**: we believe, arguably, it seems, perhaps.
- **No patronizing**: simply, just, easy, easily, obviously, straightforward.
- **No filler**: in order to → to; it should be noted that → delete; utilize → use.
- **Be specific**: give the number instead of "numerous".
- **Contractions are fine**: it's, don't, you're — but not it'll, would've, mustn't.
- **Spell out negatives in warnings**: "do not", "cannot".

### Grammar
- Singular noun as adjective: "metric browser", not "metrics browser".
- Transitive verbs need an object: "Wait until the image is rendered."
- Singular "they" for a person of unspecified gender.
- "that" restricts (no comma); "which" adds (with comma).
- Keep list items grammatically parallel.

### Formatting
- **Sentence case** in headings and titles.
- **No closing punctuation** in headings (a question mark for an FAQ heading is fine).
- **No gerund (-ing)** in task headings: "Create", not "Creating".
- **Serial comma** always.
- **Spell out 0–9** in prose; numerals from 10 up. Never open a sentence with a numeral.
- **No ampersands** — write "and".
- **Dates**: "January 31, 2026". No ordinals, no `1/31/26`.
- **Acronyms**: expand on first use; never define one in a heading.
- **Space between numeral and unit**: `100 ms`, not `100ms`.
- **No emoji** in reference documentation or UI copy.

### UI interactions (product docs)
- select (not click / tap / press, unless the device is known)
- go to (not navigate to)
- open (files, apps, terminals) / close
- enter (not type / paste / input)
- sign in (not log in); "sign in **to**"
- turn on / turn off (not enable / disable / toggle)
- select and clear (not check / uncheck)
- name the label, not the control: "Select **Save**", not "the **Save** button"

### Accessibility
- **Link text** names the destination and works out of context — never "here",
  "click here", "read more", or a bare URL.
- **Alt text** carries the image's information, not a description of the picture; empty
  alt for decorative images.
- **No sensory-only instructions**: not "the button on the right", "the button below".
- **No color-only signals**: pair color with a label.
- Real heading, list, and table markup — never bold text posing as a heading.
- Expand abbreviations on first use.

### Spelling
- American English by default: behavior, color, center, catalog, analyze, license.

## When NOT to enforce

- Code blocks and inline code — never flag terms inside backticks.
- UI labels — they are quotations of the product; reproduce them exactly.
- Third-party product names — use their official capitalization.
- Direct quotations — preserve the original wording.
- URLs, file paths, identifiers, and CLI flags.

Read these from the resolved rule set — overlay first where a file exists in both.

| `terminology.md` | Naming rules, trademarks, third-party names, and the schema for declaring your own terms |
| `word-list.md` | Excluded and discouraged words, confusables, compounds, spelling, and the entry schema |
| `voice-and-tone.md` | Clarity, directness, respect, helpfulness, contractions, passive voice |

| `formatting.md` | Headings, numbers, punctuation, lists, dates, acronyms, links, code, emoji |

Each file opens with the public authorities it is grounded in.
