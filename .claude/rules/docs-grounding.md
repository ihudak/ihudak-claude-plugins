# `$DOCS_PATH` docs grounding

Loaded when `workflows-core:docs-grounding` or `docs-grounder` is read, or the command file of any command the authority below names — the nine consumers, and the commands it records as resolving no docs grounding, whose reasons it holds. Split out of `.claude/rules/docs-workflows.md` to keep that file under 20,000 characters, and because its rules bind commands in `product-workflows` as well as `docs-workflows`.

## Authority

`plugins/workflows-core/references/docs-grounding.md` is the **single source of truth** for `$DOCS_PATH` documentation grounding — the resolution gate (`${DOCS_PATH:-/workspace/docs}`, read-only, silent-skip), the `resolve-docs-grounding` procedure, and the grill-rank / writer-attach consumption modes; consumed by nine commands — grill-rank: `/idea`, `/create-prd`, `/update-prd`, `/create-ard`, `/specify`, `/brd-intake`; writer-attach: `/epics`, `/release-notes`; lead-only: `/prd-ground` — not `/document`, and deliberately not `/brd-split`, `/brd-interview`, `/brd-package`, `/brd-reconcile`, `/prd-proposal` or `/brd-proposal` — six commands that resolve no docs grounding at all, five of which say so where they turn grounding off: `/brd-interview`, `/brd-package` and `/brd-reconcile` work only from findings already verified, a register, or the customer's own returned words, and the two effort-proposal commands take an estimate's inputs to be the specs tree and the profile, a documentation page bearing on how a feature is described rather than on what it costs to build. `/brd-split` is the exception in both directions: it allocates requirements, which documentation does not inform, and that reason is stated in `.claude/rules/docs-grounding.md` and **not** in its own body. **`/docs-init`, `/docs-brand`, `/docs-serve` and `/docs-audit` resolve no docs grounding either, and the reason is recorded in `.claude/rules/docs-grounding.md` so it is not re-litigated on the strength of the repositories they open (`/docs-audit`'s own Phase 0 step 7 records its reason).** `/docs-init` and `/docs-brand` do read repositories — a *code* repo, which is where a logo and a colour pair are extracted from, and a *docs* repo, which is the target they write into — but neither is grounding: grounding retrieves prose *about a product* to rank a challenge or attach a digest to an artifact being authored, and what these two author is configuration, CSS and a scaffold. `/docs-init` meets `${DOCS_PATH:-/workspace/docs}` only as a **write-target** rung of `docs-workflows:docs-workflow/repo-resolution`'s inverted ladder, on the *opposite* predicate to every grounding consumer (D23): a `$DOCS_PATH` carrying a docs signal is a stop there, not a match. `/docs-serve` reads a profile and starts a process. In `/prd-ground` a document is a lead and a divergence finding, **never** evidence for a `[CG#n]`, and a doc-versus-code divergence carries no identifier of its own — it names the verified `[CG#n]` it diverges from.

## Invariants

### Key invariants for `$DOCS_PATH` docs grounding

- Read-only; never writes into `$DOCS_PATH`; advisory only — never a gate or reviewer BLOCKER
- Default ON when `$DOCS_PATH` (`:-/workspace/docs`) is a readable dir with ≥1 markdown file; `--no-docs` off, `--docs <path>` override (declared by the shared reference for all nine consumers and now parsed by all nine); `/prd-ground` additionally forces it off under `--no-code`, as a caller-side override rather than a rung in the shared procedure; every miss is a silent non-blocking skip ([why](../../docs/maintainers/rationale.md#docs-grounding-flags))
- Grill commands rank challenges into the Impact × Uncertainty gap list (never append — preserves `/idea`'s ≤10 bound); `/brd-intake` runs a walk rather than a grill, so ranking reorders it and a challenge may be raised as a further defect candidate behind the same human confirmation; writer commands attach the digest
- `docs-grounder` retrieves via `qmd` CLI (no skill installed) but only ever **probes** the index — it never builds or refreshes one; index building and refreshing happen only in `resolve-docs-grounding` step 3.5, and the two are gated differently — **a build always asks first; a refresh does not**, running `timeout 60s qmd update` unprompted and prompting only where that cap is breached (`workflows-core:docs-grounding` step 3.5, and its *Invariants* state the distinction outright) — with keyword + `git log --grep` fallback; the one write root `SPECS_PATH` stays strict (no default)
