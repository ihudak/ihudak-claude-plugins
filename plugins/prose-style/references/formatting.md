# Formatting

Headings, numbers, punctuation, lists, dates, acronyms, link text, code, and emoji.

**Baseline.** These are the shipped, vendor-neutral defaults. A repo-local or env-var
overlay layers on top of them and wins on conflict — see `prose-style-checker` step 1
("Resolve the active rule set") and the plugin README. Where two public authorities
disagree, the split is named below so an overlay can pick the other side deliberately.

**Grounded in:** Microsoft Writing Style Guide (headings, capitalization, numbers,
punctuation, lists, dates); Google developer documentation style guide (same topics,
plus code-in-text); The Chicago Manual of Style (serial comma, hyphenation, dashes,
general punctuation); AP Stylebook (named where it diverges from Chicago); W3C WCAG 2.2
(link text, heading structure).

## Headings and titles

### Sentence case

Capitalize the first word and proper nouns only. Microsoft and Google both use
sentence case for headings; Apple uses title case for UI element names, which is a
separate rule (see `ui-interactions.md`).

- ✅ Configure retention policies for audit logs
- ❌ Configure Retention Policies for Audit Logs

*Overlay point:* an organization that follows title case for headings overrides this
rule in its own `formatting.md`.

### No closing punctuation

- ✅ Set up single sign-on
- ❌ Set up single sign-on.
- Exception: a question-style heading keeps its question mark — "What is a workspace?"

### No gerund (-ing) forms in task headings

- ✅ Create an alert rule — ❌ Creating an alert rule
- ✅ Migrate from v1 to v2 — ❌ Migrating from v1 to v2

### Heading structure

- One H1 per page — the page title.
- Do not skip levels (H2 → H4). Headings carry document structure for assistive
  technology (WCAG 1.3.1).
- A heading describes the section that follows; it is not a sentence and not a link.
- Do not define an acronym in a heading — define it in the first paragraph below.
- Do not put the only instance of a critical term in a heading; body text must stand
  alone when headings are collapsed.

### Subtitles

- Use a colon, and capitalize the first word after it.
- ✅ Capacity planning: forecast demand before you buy
- ❌ Capacity planning — Forecast demand before you buy

---

## Numbers

### In sentences

- Spell out zero through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.
  - ✅ The cluster has three nodes. ✅ The cluster has 12 nodes.
- Never start a sentence with a numeral — rewrite, or spell it out.
  - ✅ Twelve jobs failed. — ❌ 12 jobs failed.
- Use numerals for all numbers in a comparison series, even below 10.
  - ✅ The set contains 3, 12, and 40 entries.
- ✅ More than 10 — ❌ 10 or more (when you mean strictly greater)

### In headings, tables, and UI

Numerals are fine at any value, including 0–9: "5 ways to cut query cost".

### Measurements, currency, and percentages

- Always numerals: 8 GB, $100, 3.5 lb, 75 °F, 250 ms.
- Insert a space between the numeral and the unit: ✅ 100 ms — ❌ 100ms.
- No space before `%`, `$`, or a degree sign attached to a scale: ✅ 100%, $100.
- Use the digit for a version number exactly as the product prints it.

### Separators and large numbers

- Comma as the thousands separator at four digits and above: 3,450 — 1,200,000.
- No comma in years, page numbers, addresses, or port numbers.
- For round numbers at a million or above, use numeral + word: 8 billion events,
  $3 million per year.

### Ranges

- Use "from X to Y" or "between X and Y" in prose; an en dash (–) in tables and
  headings: 10–20 requests.
- Never mix: ❌ from 10–20.

---

## Punctuation

### Serial (Oxford) comma — required

Chicago, Microsoft, and Google all require it; AP omits it.

- ✅ ingest, transform, and query
- ❌ ingest, transform and query

*Overlay point:* an AP-following organization overrides this rule.

### Comma after an introductory phrase

- ✅ After the migration completes, restart the service.
- ❌ After the migration completes restart the service.

### No comma in a compound predicate

- ✅ The agent collects metrics and forwards them to the gateway.
- ❌ The agent collects metrics, and forwards them to the gateway.
- A comma **is** correct between two independent clauses with different subjects:
  ✅ The agent collects metrics, and the gateway stores them.

### Ampersand

- ❌ Support & services — ✅ Support and services
- Exception: a space-constrained UI label, or a name that officially contains one
  (AT&T, Procter & Gamble).

### Dashes (Chicago)

- **Em dash (—)** for a break in thought. This baseline sets them **closed** (no
  spaces) — Chicago's convention. AP and several house styles space them.
  - ✅ Processes are host-scoped—usually tied to one machine—while services are not.
  - *Overlay point:* flip to spaced em dashes, or to spaced en dashes, in your overlay.
- **En dash (–)** for ranges and for compound adjectives with an open element.
- **Hyphen (-)** for compound modifiers only. See `grammar.md` for hyphenation.

### Quotation marks

- Double quotes for quoted text; single quotes only inside a quotation.
- In American style, commas and periods go inside the closing quote.
- Do not use quotation marks for emphasis or for UI labels — use bold for UI labels.

### Colons and semicolons

- A colon introduces a list, a definition, or an explanation. The clause before it must
  stand alone as a sentence.
- Use semicolons sparingly; prefer two sentences.

### Slashes

- Avoid `and/or` — say what you mean ("A, B, or both").
- Avoid a slash for alternatives in prose; write "or".

### Parentheses for acronyms

- Full term first, acronym second: ✅ service level objective (SLO)
- ❌ SLO (Service Level Objective)

---

## Acronyms and abbreviations

- Expand on first use per page, then use the acronym consistently (WCAG 3.1.4).
- Do not capitalize the expansion unless it is a proper noun.
  - ✅ software-defined networking (SDN)
  - ❌ Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
- Do not define an acronym you use only once — use the full term.
- Do not add an apostrophe to a plural acronym: ✅ APIs — ❌ API's.
- Spell out Latin abbreviations in prose: "for example" not "e.g."; "that is" not
  "i.e."; "and so on" not "etc.".

---

## Lists

### Bulleted lists

- Introduce with a lead-in. Use a colon when the lead-in is a complete sentence.
- Keep items parallel in grammatical form (see `grammar.md`).
- If the items are complete sentences, each ends with a period.
- If the items are fragments of three words or fewer, use no terminal punctuation.
- If the items complete the lead-in sentence, punctuate the last one with a period and
  the rest with nothing.
- Aim for two to seven items. A longer list usually wants a table or subheadings.

### Numbered lists

- Only for ordered content: sequential procedures or ranked items.
- One action per step. Each step is a complete imperative sentence with a period.
- State the location before the action within a step: "In **Settings**, select **Users**."

### Tables

- Every column has a header. Do not leave cells empty — use an em dash or "None".
- Do not use a table for layout; tables are for tabular data (WCAG 1.3.1).

---

## Dates and times

- **Dates:** month day, year — "January 31, 2026". Spell the month; do not abbreviate
  it in prose.
  - ❌ 31 January 2026 (non-US order), ❌ 1/31/26 (ambiguous across locales)
  - Use ISO 8601 (`2026-01-31`) for machine-readable or log content only.
  - No ordinals: ❌ February 21st — ✅ February 21.
- **Times:** 12-hour clock with AM/PM in prose ("10:45 AM"); 24-hour only where the
  product itself shows 24-hour.
- Include the time zone whenever the time is actionable: "10:45 AM UTC".
- **Seasons are hemisphere-dependent** — use a quarter or a month: ✅ Q1 2026 —
  ❌ this winter.
- Do not write a duration as a bare number: ✅ for 30 seconds — ❌ for 30.

---

## Link text

See `accessibility.md` for the full WCAG rules. In brief:

- Link text names the destination and works read out of context.
- ❌ "here", "this page", "link", "read more", "click here", a bare URL.
- Sentence case, no closing punctuation inside the link.
- Say what the reader gets: ✅ "See [rate limits]" — ❌ "See [the documentation]".

---

## Code and UI in text

- Inline code, identifiers, file paths, flags, and literal values go in backticks.
- Do not apply prose rules inside code — no sentence casing, no serial commas, no
  spelling correction. See the checker's context rules.
- **Bold** for UI labels the reader acts on; do not add the control type:
  ✅ Select **Save** — ❌ Select the **Save** button.
- Use a code block with a language tag for anything longer than one line.
- Do not put a period inside a command line the reader copies.

---

## Emoji and symbols

- No emoji in reference documentation, UI copy, or API docs. They render
  inconsistently, translate poorly, and are read aloud verbatim by screen readers.
- Emoji in changelogs, READMEs, or internal notes are an organization's call — an
  overlay decision, not a baseline one.
- Do not use ASCII art, arrows made of characters (`-->`), or `<` `>` for navigation
  in prose; write "go to A, then B" or use a real separator.
