Fix security vulnerabilities: $ARGUMENTS

**Core references.** A citation of the form `workflows-core:<name>` names a shared reference in the `workflows-core` plugin. Load it with `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "<name>")` — never by path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to this plugin, which does not carry it.

Each argument token is either `ADDRESS:CVE-ID` (e.g. `PROJ-2423:CVE-2023-46604`) or a bare `CVE-ID` (e.g. `CVE-2023-46604`). Parse and filter each token, research all CVEs first, then fix them one at a time.

---

## Step 0 — Classify & Route (mandatory)

Invoke the `model-routing` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "workflows-core:model-routing"`) to load the classification rules, then classify **per CVE**, based on the size of the required repository change — not the CVE category alone.

Default heuristics:

| Required fix (from research output) | Classification |
|---|---|
| Patch or same-major minor bump, no source-code changes expected | `MODERATE` |
| Major version bump, or code changes required to adopt the new version | `SIGNIFICANT` |
| Major bump of a security-critical library, or code changes in auth/session/token/permission/payment/audit paths | `HIGH-RISK` |

Because the required fix is not known up front, start with a provisional `MODERATE` routing block for research, then finalize the classification from the research report **before** fix application begins.

**Specs-repo preflight.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git specs-preflight")` and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline: flush any leftover session artifacts from an earlier run, retry an artifact commit that failed to push, and settle the branch. This runs against `$SPECS_PATH` only — `git -C "$SPECS_PATH"`, never a `cd`, so the code repo this run is about to branch and fix is untouched (§1 rule 1). Prompt-free and silent when the specs repo is clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5 notice; if it returns `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag for the whole run — the terminal `commit-artifacts` step skips on it.

---

## Step 1 — Prepare

1. **Parse** — Extract the optional address and the CVE ID from each token. The address is a key resolved against `$SPECS_PATH` with `resolve-address` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3), never a tracker lookup; a token may carry none.
2. **Determine the no-address placeholder** — Scan recent branch names and commit history for `NOISSUE` / `NOJIRA` / `NO-JIRA`; use whichever the project already writes when a token carries no address. <!-- vendor-token-ok: literals a repo's own branch/commit history may contain, matched rather than minted -->
3. **Filter** — Skip non-CVE IDs (`CWE-*`, OWASP patterns) with a warning.
4. **Snapshot repo context** — Note the repo path and, when obvious, the primary ecosystem so the research agent can disambiguate detection.
5. **Resolve the branch name per CVE** — Apply the "Git Workflow → Branch naming" section below now, once per CVE token, and record each result as that CVE's `branch`. This is the **only** place a branch name is produced: `vuln-fixer` creates the branch it is handed and never derives one, and Step 3.9 pushes the same value. A run that reaches the fixer without a `branch` in its prompt is a defect — the agent would invent a name, the orchestrator would push a different one, and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md` §2.1 check 4 would fail the gate on the mismatch.

---

## Step 2 — Research (parallel)

Invoke one research task per valid CVE. Use a single agent message for the batch.

```
task(
  subagent_type: "dev-workflows:vuln-research",
  model: `<detection_model — §2.1 Sonnet chain>`,
  description: "Research CVE",
  prompt: "## Vuln Research Request
  repo: [absolute repo path]
  cves:
    - id: [CVE-ID]
      address: [optional folder key]
  ecosystem_hint: [optional]
  model_routing:
    classification: MODERATE
    reason: <one-line>
    current_model: <the model this orchestrator is running under>
    detection_model: <§2.1 Sonnet chain: claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6/4-5>   # vuln-research; vuln-fixer (SIMPLE/MODERATE); review-fixer
    planning_model: <§2 Opus chain>   # vuln-fixer escalates here only if HIGH-RISK
    review_model:  <§2 Opus chain>    # code-review (frontmatter-pinned; recorded, no override)
    opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
    gate_tests_on_review: false
    notes: <any §2 / §2.1 fallback or degradation>"
)
```

Collect all reports:
- `READY` → candidate for fixing
- `NOT_IN_REPO` → notify and skip
- `LOOKUP_FAILED` → warn and offer retry or skip
- `SKIP_NON_CVE` → already filtered; no further action

Finalize the per-CVE classification from the research output. If the finalized class is `HIGH-RISK`, re-run `vuln-research` on Opus for a confirmation pass. If it is `SIGNIFICANT`, re-run on Opus when the major bump or breaking-change surface is non-trivial.

---

## Step 3 — Fix (sequential)

Process `READY` CVEs one at a time to avoid conflicting edits to the same dependency files.

For each `READY` CVE, before invoking the fixer, write its research report to a temp file (`command mktemp -t dw-vuln-research-XXXXXX`, never inside a repo tree) and record its absolute path as `research_file`; the fixer, code-review, and resume steps below receive this path instead of the pasted report.

**Record the tree state once, before anything is applied.** On the first CVE, run `git -C "<repo>" status --porcelain -z --untracked-files=all` and record the result as `pre_existing_dirty`; carry it unchanged through every CVE in the run. **`-z` is not decoration**: §2.2 carve-out 1 enumerates in that form and subtracts this set from it, and without `-z` a path carrying a space or a non-ASCII byte is recorded quoted here, subtracts against nothing there, and is swept into this run's commit. `/vuln` never stashes, so `stash_ref` is always `null`. This capture is what lets Step 3.9 keep a bystander's work out of the commit (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md` §2.2 carve-out 1) — `/vuln` offers no dirty-tree prompt, so the capture is the whole safeguard and must happen before the first edit.

**Start each CVE from the base branch, not from the previous CVE's.** After that `pre_existing_dirty` capture — and before the test baseline below, which is taken on the base tree this settles — resolve the base per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md` §2.8 and run `git -C "<repo>" switch <base>` when HEAD is not already there. Every CVE gets its own branch and its own pull request, so a CVE that branches off its predecessor ships that predecessor's fix inside its own diff, its own review, and its own PR.

Three rules make that switch safe:

- **Confirm before leaving a branch the user chose.** On the **first** CVE, if HEAD is already on a non-default branch, do not switch silently — the user may be deliberately working there. Ask: `choices: ["Switch to <base> and branch each CVE from it (Recommended)", "Branch each CVE from <current> instead", "Cancel"]`. On later CVEs the branch HEAD sits on is one this run created, so switch without asking.
- **A failed switch stops the run, it does not proceed.** `git switch` aborts when a tracked file differs between the two branches. Report the abort and the paths git named, and stop — continuing would branch this CVE off whatever HEAD happens to be, which is the contamination this rule exists to prevent.
- **Verify the tree before the next CVE, rather than trusting the previous CVE's status.** Re-run the porcelain command; anything present that is not in `pre_existing_dirty` is residue the previous CVE left behind (a partial revert — `BUILD_FAILED` reverts the files the research report named, which for a lockfile ecosystem is not all of them). Surface it and stop rather than carrying it onto the next CVE's branch.

### Capture the test baseline — once, before the first CVE is worked

It runs after the base-branch switch above has settled, on the base tree — the tree every CVE branches from, so one capture is what every CVE's verify compares against and a second would measure the same tree again. Dispatch `test-baseliner` in `capture` mode with `model: <detection_model — §2.1 Sonnet chain>` and `Project root: [absolute repo path]` — the same path this Step sends every `vuln-fixer` dispatch as `repo:`, and the root `vuln-fixer` step 5's verify call names in turn, because `### Suites` records each marker as a path relative to whatever root a call scanned, so two roots make every marker path disagree between the calls (`dev-workflows:test-baseliner` capture step 1, measured there). **Keep the returned `## Test Baseline` block whole** — it is re-supplied as `baseline_block` on every dispatch below, because its `### Suites` rows are what let verify tell a suite that regressed from one that could not run at either end; `passing_count` and `passing_tests` are re-keyed from it, never in place of it.

**This is the run's only test-baseline capture, and it is the orchestrator's on both paths.** `vuln-fixer` never takes one of its own: the question a failed capture raises is one only the orchestrator can put — subagents have no interactive tools — so a capture taken privately inside the agent is one the operator was never offered a say in. That is why `baseline_tests: run-fresh` is retired from the handoff rather than left standing as a second way in (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/handoff/vuln-fixer.md`), and why `BASELINE_FAILED` is retired with it: that status existed to report a capture this command no longer delegates.

Act on the returned `Status` before dispatching anything:

- `OK` or `NO_TESTS` → proceed. **A `NO_TESTS` capture is not a failure and is not asked about**: every suite ran cleanly and the repository holds no tests (`dev-workflows:test-baseliner` capture step 4), so nothing was lost and no CVE's finish is marked down for it.
- `PARTIAL` → proceed, and name the suites `### Suites` does not mark `OK` or `NO_TESTS`, each with the command that failed, in **every** CVE's `Notes` cell in the Step 4 table — the capture is the run's, so a suite it could not cover is uncovered for every CVE in it. A runner that is not installed for one language is not a reason to leave a CVE in another unfixed.
- `RUN_FAILED` or `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` → **nothing was captured, and what to do about it is the operator's decision rather than this command's.** Surface the block's `### Suites` rows and its `### Notes` lines first — a hint has an answer to give wherever a note names the runner's own command — then ask:

  `choices: ["Specify test command to use", "Apply the fixes unverified (every pull request opens as a draft carrying the DO-NOT-MERGE banner)", "Cancel this run"]`

  - **Specify test command to use** → take free text, record it as `test_command_hint`, and re-dispatch the capture **immediately**, adding the line `command_hint: [the answer]` to the prompt. Act on the returned `Status` by this same list. Ask at most twice in a run; after that record `baseline_unverified` with the last capture failure as its reason and proceed as the option below does.
  - **Apply the fixes unverified** → record `baseline_unverified` and work every CVE. Each that reaches its verify finishes `clean_finish: false` at Step 3.9, so each pull request is a draft the banner says not to merge.
  - **Cancel this run** → stop here. No branch was cut and no file edited, so there is nothing to hand off and no CVE is reported worked. **Say where the tree is left**, though, and read it rather than asserting it: the base-branch switch above has already run **unless the first-CVE question was answered *Branch each CVE from `<current>` instead***, on which no switch was issued and HEAD is still where the operator put it. Name the branch they started on and the one they are on now.

**The question is asked once per run and its answer reused, for the same reason §2.4's consent choice is**: a baseline is a property of the repository, this command works one repository throughout, and re-asking per CVE would put the same question to the same tree.

**Where `test_command_hint` was recorded, every later `test-baseliner` call in this run carries it** — which here means every `vuln-fixer` dispatch carries it as `command_hint:`, because the verify calls are the agent's and not this command's (step 5). **A verify over a different set of suites is not a comparison**, and dropping the hint does not merely lose the verification, it manufactures a wrong answer in both directions: a hint that matched no detected suite leaves a verify with nothing to detect, returning `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` and finishing every CVE `TESTS_NOT_RUN` after the operator supplied a command that worked; and a hint that named a working alternative to a broken runner leaves its `command_hint#<n>` row with no counterpart, so every baseline test of it falls out as **Missing from run** and the verify reports `REGRESSIONS` — putting `revert` on the menu for a security fix against a regression nothing caused (`dev-workflows:test-baseliner` verify step 2's `gone since the baseline` bullet). `/implement` states the same rule for its own dispatches; this command's hint has one extra boundary to cross, which is the whole of the difference.

**`baseline_unverified` does not distinguish its two provenances, and that is a deliberate divergence from `/implement` rather than an oversight.** There the operator's own *"Skip tests for this run"* is honoured without penalty while the run's own record after two failed `command_hint` attempts sets `clean_finish: false` (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md` §2.9). Here both finish `false`: what ships unverified is a security remediation, the flag's only effect is the draft and its banner, and this state already finished `false` before the question existed — an uncovering baseline still returns `RUN_FAILED` at verify, which `vuln-fixer` step 5 turns into `TESTS_NOT_RUN` (`dev-workflows:test-baseliner` verify's pre-step gate). Honouring the answer by clearing the flag would be a loosening, not a symmetry.

**And carry every `### Notes` line the block opens with `CAVEAT: ` into every CVE's `Notes` cell whatever the `Status` was**, `OK` included: a marked line says the baseline is not what its counts claim — a qualifying suite nothing ran, counts a `Make` indirection may have summed twice, a `Make` fold's identifiers unattributed to what printed them — none of which the `Status` or the `### Suites` rows can be read off (`dev-workflows:test-baseliner` capture step 5). The mark is the agent's, so nothing here judges which note matters; an unmarked note records where a command ran and is not carried.

### SIMPLE / MODERATE path

Invoke `vuln-fixer` with the baseline this run captured above:

)
```

If the fixer returns `status: BLOCKED`, the research report at `research_file` could not be
read — an orchestrator bug, not a user choice: report the unreadable path to the user, mark
this CVE `BLOCKED` in the Step 4 summary table, and stop working this CVE. Do not retry with
a fresh research pass — that would re-derive the evidence instead of surfacing the failure.

**Read the fixer's `notes` on whatever it returns, not only on a stop.** The run's own capture above already accounts for what the *baseline* could not cover; what only the fixer can report is what its **verify** met — a suite the baseline did cover and this verify could not run, which a verify `PARTIAL` returns as `status: SUCCESS` with those suites named in `notes`; every `NEW-FAILURE: ` line it marked, which no status carries at all; and every `CAVEAT: ` line that report carried, which no status gates either (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/handoff/vuln-fixer.md`). Carry them into this CVE's `Notes` cell in the Step 4 table. A `SUCCESS` whose `notes` nobody read is a CVE reported fixed with a stack silently unverified.

Otherwise, if the fixer returns `status: TEST_REGRESSION`, follow "Handling Test Failures"
below, then re-invoke `vuln-fixer` with `phase: regression-resume` + the chosen
`regression_decision`, passing the same CVE input with the original research report
re-supplied from `research_file`.

If the resumed agent returns `status: BLOCKED`, the re-supplied file path could not be read:
report the named path to the user and stop this CVE. Do NOT retry, and do NOT reconstruct
the artifact — a resume that re-derives its own input is the failure
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/context-management.md`'s read-failure contract exists to
prevent.

### SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK path

1. **The baseline is the run's, and was captured above.** This path takes no capture of its own — it did until the two paths were made symmetric, and the reason it stopped is that the question a failed capture raises belongs to the operator on both of them. Re-supply the same `## Test Baseline` block whole as `baseline_block` below, with `passing_count` and `passing_tests` re-keyed from it. Everything that capture owes the Step 4 table — the `PARTIAL` suites it could not cover, every `CAVEAT: ` line it marked — is recorded there for every CVE in the run, this one included, rather than per CVE here. **This step keeps its number rather than being struck out**, because the resume rules below are cited by step number from this command's own Step 3.9.
2. **Invoke `vuln-fixer` with review gating enabled**:

```text <!-- vendor-token-ok: the no-address placeholder literals Step 1 detected, echoed into the handoff -->

  subagent_type: "dev-workflows:vuln-fixer",

    notes: <any §2 / §2.1 fallback or degradation>

  read the single READY research report from the file at [`research_file`]"
)
```

3. **Handle a `vuln-fixer` stop.** If the fixer returns `status: BLOCKED`, the research report at `research_file` could not be read — an orchestrator bug, not a user choice: report the unreadable path to the user, mark this CVE `BLOCKED` in the Step 4 summary table, and stop working this CVE (do not retry with a fresh research pass, and do not proceed to Opus review). **Any other first-call return on this path stops this CVE short of the review, and is not run through it** — `BUILD_FAILED` is the reachable one, the fixer having reverted its own change at step 4 — so record the returned status in the Step 4 table, let Step 3.9 decide the handoff by its own tree test rather than by the label, and move to the next CVE. **`AWAITING_REVIEW` is the only return this path's review dispatch fires on**, which is what makes that dispatch safe to write as a single arm; it is also why `vuln-fixer`'s step 1 must never let a baseline status end a gated call in some other state. Otherwise, if the fixer returns `AWAITING_REVIEW`, run Opus code review before tests:
   - Capture the diff to a temp file: write `git add -N . && git diff` to `command mktemp -t dw-vuln-diff-XXXXXX` (never inside a repo tree) and record its path as `review_diff_file`
   - Write the fixer output to a temp file (`command mktemp -t dw-vuln-claims-XXXXXX`, never inside a repo tree) and record its path as `claims_file`. Invoke `code-review` with the CVE summary, the research handoff (from `research_file`), the diff (from `review_diff_file`), and `claims_file: [the path]` (frontmatter-pinned to Opus; recorded as `review_model` above, no `model:` override needed)
   - **Check the review's first line before acting on the verdict.** If it is `Diff: unreadable at <path>`, the orchestrator's own `review_diff_file` could not be read — an orchestrator bug, not a user choice: surface the unreadable path to the user and stop working this CVE, marking it `BLOCKED` in the Step 4 summary table. Do NOT triage the finding and do NOT dispatch `review-fixer`: the finding names a capture failure no fixer can act on, and running the cycle would spend a fix dispatch and a re-review to arrive back here.
   - **Triage sub-step** (before any fixer dispatch): invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "finding-triage")` and follow it. For each finding, verify its claimed consequence at the location it names; keep or dismiss; record every dismissal with a reason that disposes of that finding's own claim. Hand the fixer **survivors only**, and carry the dismissal list into this run's report.
   - If review returns `BLOCK` or `PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS`, invoke `review-fixer` with model: `<detection_model — §2.1 Sonnet chain>` for the surviving `BLOCKER` and `MAJOR` findings
   - **Handle a `review-fixer` stop.** If its `Stop condition flag` is `NEEDS HUMAN`, do NOT re-run the review: surface the deferred BLOCKER(s) to the user with the reason `review-fixer` gave, mark this CVE `BLOCKED` in the Step 4 summary table, and stop working this CVE — do not continue to tests, and do not re-review. Then run Step 3.9 with `clean_finish: false`: the fix is on disk and stopping the CVE is not a reason to leave it in a working tree, so it is committed, pushed behind §2.4's consent choice, and any pull request that choice opens is a draft carrying the DO-NOT-MERGE banner (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md` §2.9). Only when the flag is `CLEAR` do you **overwrite `review_diff_file`** with a fresh `git add -N . && git diff` and re-run the Opus review once against that refreshed path — so the re-review reads the post-fix diff, not the stale pre-fix capture
   - If the second verdict is still `BLOCK`, stop and escalate; do not continue to tests. Run Step 3.9 with `clean_finish: false` — same reasoning as the `NEEDS HUMAN` stop above: the work is committed, pushed behind §2.4's consent choice, and any pull request that choice opens is a draft the banner says not to merge
   - **The recorded verdict names the version it was taken against.** Both the resumed verify step below and any regression fix that follows it change the tree after the review that produced this verdict, so the run's report states what the verdict covers and names the edits that followed it, per the `A recorded verdict names the version it was taken against` rule in `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "escalation-rules")`. Where nothing followed it, it says that too.

4. **Resume the fixer after review** — Re-invoke `vuln-fixer` with `phase: verify-resume`, **the same `repo:` this CVE's first dispatch carried**, the same baseline block, the same `command_hint:` where one was recorded, and the original research report re-supplied from `research_file`. **`repo:` is not optional on a resume**: this is the call that reaches step 5, and step 5's verify takes its `Project root:` from it with no working-directory fallback, so a resume that omits it leaves verify rooted wherever the shell happens to be and every marker path disagreeing with the baseline's. If the resumed agent returns `status: BLOCKED`, the re-supplied file path could not be read: report the named path to the user and stop this CVE. Do NOT retry, and do NOT reconstruct the artifact — a resume that re-derives its own input is the failure `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/context-management.md`'s read-failure contract exists to prevent.

5. **If the fixer returns `status: TEST_REGRESSION`** (from step 4's resumed verify), follow
   "Handling Test Failures" below, then re-invoke `vuln-fixer` with `phase: regression-resume` +
   the chosen `regression_decision`, the same `repo:`, the same baseline block, and the original research report
   re-supplied from `research_file`. If the resumed agent returns `status: BLOCKED`, the re-supplied file path could not be read: report the named path to the user and stop this CVE. Do NOT retry, and do NOT reconstruct the artifact — a resume that re-derives its own input is the failure `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/context-management.md`'s read-failure contract exists to prevent.


### Step 3.9 — Code-repo handoff (both paths, once per CVE)

`vuln-fixer` creates the fix branch **before** its first edit and leaves the change on it, uncommitted; the commit, the push, and the pull request are the orchestrator's, because the consent choice they sit behind is one only the orchestrator can ask (subagents have no interactive tools). The branch-first ordering is what makes this step reachable on the paths where the fixer never runs to completion — an `AWAITING_REVIEW` return whose review then stops the CVE still has a branch to commit onto.

Runs after the fixer's last return for this CVE — after the `verify-resume` call on the SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK path, after the `regression-resume` call where one happened. Cite `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md` and execute the full `finish-code-branch` entry point (§2) inline, with the §2.11 inputs:

- `repo` and `branch` — the repo, and the branch name Step 1 resolved and the fixer created.
- `pre_existing_dirty` — as recorded at the top of Step 3; `stash_ref: null`.
- `key` and `workitem_key` — from the folder the CVE's address resolved to (`workflows-core:addressing` §4), or `null` for a bare `CVE-ID` token.
- `commit_template` — the "Commit message" template in this command's Git Workflow section below. `/vuln` is the one caller with a full template of its own, so §2.3 uses it verbatim rather than deriving a subject from the repo's log.
- `title` — `fix(deps): <library> upgrade to remediate <CVE-ID>`, with ` [<key>]` appended when the CVE resolved one.
- `body_facts` — the CVE summary, the vulnerable range, the version change applied, the classification, the Opus review verdict and triage where the CVE went through review, and the test counts before and after.
- `clean_finish` — `false` when the CVE ended `BLOCKED` or `TESTS_NOT_RUN`, when its review is still `BLOCK`, when the user chose `keep-anyway` on a regression, or when any `notes` this CVE's fixer returned carries a line prefixed `NEW-FAILURE: `; `true` otherwise. **That last condition is not a status test and cannot be made one**: a New failure moves no `test-baseliner` `Status`, so the CVE reaches here as `SUCCESS` with a red suite behind it (`dev-workflows:test-baseliner` verify step 6, and `vuln-fixer` step 5, which marks each one in `notes` for exactly this read). **Test the prefix, not the prose** — `notes` is free text also carrying auto-fix descriptions, uncovered-suite names and a regression diagnosis, and the mark is what makes this decidable, exactly as `CAVEAT: ` is. **Read every return this CVE made, not only its last**: on a `regression-resume` the resumed call runs no verify (`vuln-fixer`'s Phase resume note), so a New failure met at the first verify is absent from the return that ends the CVE. It is the mildest of the five — nothing says the fix caused it — and it still withholds an ordinary mergeable pull request, because what the flag asks is whether this diff is safe to merge unexamined and a failing suite answers no. Per §2.9 the flag never suppresses either half: the commit is prompt-free and the push is still **offered** under §2.4's choice, and what the flag itself changes is only the pull request (draft, DO-NOT-MERGE banner). What it can change is whether that choice is put again — the paragraph below, which is where this command differs from `/implement`.

§2.4's choice is asked on the **first** CVE and reused for every later one (`code_handoff_choice`) — a ten-CVE run asks once, not ten times — **save on §2.4's re-ask triggers, and this is the caller its first one was written for.** A CVE whose `clean_finish` differs from the one the recorded answer was given under puts that choice again, naming the trigger, **and it fires in both directions**: a CVE ending `false` under an answer given at `true`, because the user authorised pushing reviewed work and not blocked work; and a clean CVE under an answer given at `false`, because otherwise a decline given on one blocked CVE governs every good fix behind it and withholds them all without saying so. *"Neither — the commit stays on this machine"* is a real answer in either case rather than an anomaly: where it is given the push does **not** happen — the commit still does, prompt-free — and where the re-asked choice is answered the other way, this CVE is pushed under its own answer rather than under the earlier one. (§2.4's second trigger, a change of `repo`, cannot fire here: `/vuln` works one repository for the whole run.) Emit the §3.1 `Code repo:` line per CVE and carry its pull-request number into the Step 4 table's `PR` column.

**What to hand off is decided by the tree, never by the status label.** Before skipping any CVE, run `git -C "<repo>" status --porcelain -z --untracked-files=all` — the same form the `pre_existing_dirty` capture used, because the two sets are compared — and compare it against `pre_existing_dirty`:

- **Anything of this run's is present** ⇒ run Step 3.9. It does not matter which status the CVE carries.
- **Nothing of this run's is present** ⇒ skip, and say why in the Step 4 table.

This is deliberately not keyed on `status`, because **`BLOCKED` means two opposite things**. It is returned by the *first* fixer call when the research report cannot be read — nothing was created, nothing changed — and by a **resume** call (the SIMPLE/MODERATE path and steps 4 and 5 of the SIGNIFICANT path) when the re-supplied path cannot be read, at which point the branch exists and the fix is already applied to it. It is also the label this command writes into the Step 4 table for orchestrator-side gate stops, two of which (`NEEDS HUMAN`, a persisting review `BLOCK`) are explicitly required above to hand off. A skip list keyed on the label would strand an applied fix on a branch, and the next CVE's `git switch` would then either abort or carry it onto an unrelated branch.

For orientation, the states that normally reach each outcome: a first-call `BLOCKED` changed nothing; `SKIPPED_BY_USER` never invoked the fixer; `TESTS_NOT_RUN` applied its fix and left it on the branch unverified, so it hands off like any other applied fix; `BUILD_FAILED` and `REVERTED` reverted their own change and normally leave the step-2 branch in place and empty — the plugin never deletes a branch (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md` §1 rule 3), so name the stray ref in the Step 4 table rather than leaving it unexplained. Each of these is still confirmed against the tree, not assumed.

**Never skipped for a CVE that failed a gate.** A CVE stopped at an unresolved review `BLOCK` or at `NEEDS HUMAN` **is** handed off with `clean_finish: false`: its fix is applied and sitting on a branch that exists precisely because the fixer created it before the first edit, and §2.9 is exactly the case for it.

---

## Step 4 — Summarise

**First remove this run's handoff files.** Nothing from here on reads one — each CVE's `research_file`,
and every `review_diff_file` and `claims_file` this run wrote on the SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK path.
Remove each as `command rm -f -- "<path>"`, per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/context-management.md` (**Hand off by file, not paste**), which says
why nothing else would. A run that stops before this step removes
the files it had made before it stops, in the same way, save a file the stop itself named as
unreadable, which stays for the operator to look at (that reference again); a **CVE** that ended
early — an unreadable `research_file` or `review_diff_file`, the `review-fixer` `NEEDS HUMAN` stop, a
second verdict still `BLOCK`, each of which stops working that CVE and not the run — keeps its files
until here, since the loop goes on to the next CVE.

After all CVEs are processed, print a result table:

```
| CVE            | Library         | Change         | Class        | Result  | PR  | Notes                                      |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|---------|-----|--------------------------------------------|
| CVE-2023-46604 | activemq-broker | 5.15.5→5.15.16 | MODERATE     | OK      | #42 | not verified: RSpec (`bin/rspec`)          |
| CVE-2024-99999 | (not in repo)   | —              | —            | SKIP    | —   |                                            |
```

**The `Result` column takes the CVE's own terminal state, and its vocabulary is fixed here because the table shows only two of it by example.** `OK` for a CVE the fixer returned `SUCCESS` — and **only** for that; `SKIP` for one never worked (`NOT_IN_REPO`, a filtered non-CVE, `SKIPPED_BY_USER`, or a `LOOKUP_FAILED` the operator chose to skip rather than retry — Step 2); otherwise the status the fixer returned or the orchestrator's own stop, written as it stands: `TESTS_NOT_RUN`, `TEST_REGRESSION`, `BUILD_FAILED`, `REVERTED`, `BLOCKED`. **`TESTS_NOT_RUN` is the one worth naming explicitly**, because it is now the ordinary outcome of a baseline that could not run — on either path, where the operator chose to apply the fixes unverified — and writing `OK` there with the qualification pushed into `Notes` would report a fix as verified whose tests nobody ran. `OK` in this column means the comparison happened and found no regression; nothing else earns it.

**The `Notes` column is where a suite this run did not verify is named, and it is filled on both paths from the same two sources.** A CVE can otherwise be reported `OK` with a whole stack unverified, which is exactly what this column exists to prevent. The sources differ in scope rather than by path, which is what the run-level capture made true of both:

- **The run's own baseline** (Step 3's capture) — every suite its `### Suites` does not mark `OK` or `NO_TESTS`, with the command that failed. It is captured once, so whatever it could not cover is uncovered for **every** CVE in the run and goes in every row's cell, not just the first.
- **That CVE's own `vuln-fixer` `notes`** — read on **every** return and not only on a stop, because a verify `PARTIAL` comes back as `status: SUCCESS` with its suites named there (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/handoff/vuln-fixer.md`'s own `SUCCESS` gloss). This is the only source for a suite the baseline **did** cover and this CVE's verify could not run — a suite can stop being runnable between the two calls, and the baseline cannot know that.

Name each suite and its command, or leave the cell empty where the run verified everything it detected — never a bare "partial", which says a stack was missed without saying which. **Every `CAVEAT: ` line either source carried goes in this cell too, verbatim and whatever the status was.** That mark is the baseliner's own on a note whose harm the `Status`, the counts and the test lists do not show, so it is carried without being judged here, and it is what puts a CVE green at both ends into this cell at all — every other source named above needs a suite the run could not cover. An unmarked note records where a command ran and is not carried. **Every `NEW-FAILURE: ` line the fixer marked goes in this cell as well**, named test by test and taken from every return this CVE made rather than only its last: it is the one entry here that is not about coverage — the suite ran and something in it is red — and it is also the one that moved this CVE's `clean_finish` to `false`. **Where the run's own capture and the fixer's `notes` name the same uncovered suite, write it once**: on a `PARTIAL` baseline both sources carry it by design, the capture because it is the run's and the fixer because its own step 1 read the same block, and this cell is a report rather than a tally.

**Where the run recorded `baseline_unverified`, state it once above the table** — the capture failure that produced it, whether it was the operator's own answer or the run's own record after two failed `command_hint` attempts, and that every CVE below therefore finished unverified. That line is the flag's only reader and its whole purpose: `clean_finish` reaches `false` through `TESTS_NOT_RUN` without consulting it, so without this the run would have recorded a decision nothing ever surfaces, and the table would show a column of `TESTS_NOT_RUN` with no statement of why.

Append a `### Model Routing` section summarising the per-CVE classification, why it was chosen, the models used, and any Opus review verdicts.

Append a `### Review triage` section with one line per CVE that went through Opus review: - **Review triage:** [N findings reviewed, M survived] — dismissals: [one line per dismissal, `finding — reason`; or "none"] — or "N/A (SIMPLE / MODERATE path, no Opus review)" for CVEs that never reached review.

Then invoke `impl-maintenance` (subagent_type: `"workflows-core:impl-maintenance"`, model: `<detection_model — §2.1 Sonnet chain>`) with a compact session handoff covering the CVEs fixed, notable regressions, workarounds, and overall outcome. **Always pass `Command run: /vuln`** in that handoff — omitting it makes `impl-maintenance` default to `/implement`, mislabeling the run.

**Context hygiene.** This was a large run — consider **`/compact`** to free context before your next task (per `workflows-core:session-hygiene` §3 — non-pipeline, so `/compact` only; guidance only).

**Then persist plugin feedback (automatic).** After `impl-maintenance` returns, project its plugin-facing slice into the specs repo by invoking `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "feedback-emission emit-auto")` and calling its `emit-auto` entry point (§6). Pass the Lessons Learned report, `command: /vuln`, the run's `key` (or `null`) and `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). `emit-auto` renders only the report's **Command workflow improvements**, **New agents / skills**, and plugin **Reference docs** sections plus the **Key observations** that triggered them (§4 plugin-facing predicate) — never target-project `CLAUDE.md`/hook advice — as `origin: auto` entries, dedupes by stable `id` (§3), resolves the target via the §2 specs-first ladder, and writes silently. List the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted") after the lessons-learned report. ADDITIVE — the impl-maintenance report still appears in the output; this step NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits (still true — the assertion is scoped to *this step*, which only writes the feedback file; those writes are committed by the separate terminal `commit-artifacts` step, per `workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §4), and NEVER writes into the code repo or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository.

**Then commit session artifacts (terminal).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git commit-artifacts")` and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — the LAST action of the run. It stages ONLY the §2.1 bounded artifact paths inside `$SPECS_PATH`, commits `<KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (/vuln)` — or `NOISSUE …` when the run resolved no key — and pushes per §4 step 5. It NEVER touches the code repo this run just fixed: that repo's per-CVE branches and commits were Step 3.9's, as were whatever pushes and pull requests §2.4's consent choice, §2.8's base-branch ladder and §2.6's `gh` capability probe allowed, through a different reference and against a different remote. It NEVER force-pushes, NEVER fails the run, and skips entirely when the run carries `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting that notice. Print its §6 outcome line after the feedback path, prefixed `Specs repo:`, with any guard notice repeated in full. No `resume.md` is written for `/vuln` (`workflows-core:session-hygiene` §1 skip list — the durable state is the branch and PR).

---

## Handling Test Failures

`vuln-fixer` cannot prompt the user directly — dispatched subagents have no access to
interactive tools, even when one is listed in their `tools:`. When it returns
`status: TEST_REGRESSION` (previously-green tests now failing, not auto-fixable), the
**orchestrator** (this command, running in the interactive session) handles the decision:

- Present the failing tests clearly (from the fixer's `failing_tests` / `diagnosis`).
- Ask — no option is safe to recommend across arbitrary regressions, so this list carries no `(Recommended)` marker and the qualifying condition sits in the option's own description (per the marker rule in `workflows-core:escalation-rules`):
  ```
  choices: ["Apply the fix anyway and flag the failures in the PR — for flaky tests", "Revert this fix and skip it", "Investigate further"]
  ```
- **"Investigate further"** → show more detail (the diff, full failure output) and re-ask
  the same choices — this loops here at the orchestrator until the user picks apply or revert.
- Map the final choice to `regression_decision: keep-anyway | revert` and re-invoke
  `vuln-fixer` with `phase: regression-resume` (see Step 3).

**`status: TESTS_NOT_RUN` is a different return and takes no `regression_decision`.** It means the
verify call compared nothing — no failing tests to show, and nothing about this CVE's tests known either
way. The fix stays on its branch. Report the reason the fixer recorded, mark the CVE unverified in the
Step 4 table, and hand it off through Step 3.9 with `clean_finish: false`. Never map it onto `revert`:
rolling a security fix back because a suite could not be started is a decision taken on no evidence at all.

## Git Workflow

### Branch naming

Resolve the branch name by invoking `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "branch-naming")` and following it — **the repo's own documented convention wins**. The orchestrator reads the repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTION.md`, `README.md`, `DOCUMENTATION-GUIDELINES.md`, `CLAUDE.md` for a branch-naming section (§1.1), fills its segments (§1.2) — **identity** from the §2 ladder (`$GIT_USER_INITIALS` → `git config user.initials` → inference → the §2.5 prompt), **issue key** from the CVE's address when the token carried one (else the documented no-issue literal, or the placeholder detected in Step 1 step 2), **description** from the CVE ID — and hands the resolved name to `vuln-fixer`. Never add an identity segment the pattern does not ask for.

When the repo documents no convention (§1.4), `<prefix>` comes from the §2 ladder with fallback `fix/`:

- With an address: `<prefix>/<KEY>-CVE-XXXX-XXXXX`
- Without one: `<prefix>/<placeholder>-CVE-XXXX-XXXXX` (or `<prefix>/CVE-XXXX-XXXXX` if the project omits placeholders)

### Commit message

Applied by the orchestrator in Step 3.9, never by `vuln-fixer` — it is passed to `finish-code-branch` as `commit_template` and used verbatim (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md` §2.3). Use the project's existing style. **End the subject with `[<key>]`** where the run resolved one, and carry a `Work-Item:` trailer where the resolved folder has one (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "implementation-format")`, §3). Default template:

**With an address:**
```
fix(deps): upgrade <library> to <version> to remediate <CVE-ID> [<key>]

Resolves <ADDRESS>
Fixes <CVE-ID> - <one-line CVE description>

Vulnerable range: <range>

**Without an address:**
```

Fixes <CVE-ID> - <one-line CVE description>

Vulnerable range: <range>

```

### Commit, push, and PR

All three are Step 3.9's, through `finish-code-branch` (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md` §2) — never `vuln-fixer`'s. The commit-message template above is passed as that step's `commit_template` and used verbatim (§2.3).

- Base branch: resolved per §2.8's ladder — `origin/HEAD`, then `origin/main`, `origin/master`, `origin/develop`. Never assumed.
- Title: `fix(deps): <library> upgrade to remediate <CVE-ID>` (append ` [<key>]` when the CVE resolved one)
- Body: CVE summary, vulnerable range, version change made, classification, review verdict and triage where the CVE went through review, and test results (pass count before vs. after)
- Opened with `gh` behind §2.6's capability probe; on any failure the run falls back to §3.2's manual-open text rather than reporting a pull request that does not exist. A `clean_finish: false` CVE gets a draft plus the DO-NOT-MERGE banner (§2.9).

---

## Invariants (always enforced)

- ALWAYS `emit-block` (per `workflows-core:feedback-emission`) before escalating a halt caused by a **plugin / skill / command / reference gap** (a capability the run needed but the plugin lacked) — so a run abandoned at the block still records it. NEVER for a work-quality review BLOCK or an environment / user halt (repo-missing, dirty-tree, key-not-found, cancellation)
- ALWAYS classify **per CVE** after research
- NEVER use Opus for a `MODERATE` fix unless the user explicitly asks for it
- NEVER run tests for a `SIGNIFICANT` / `HIGH-RISK` CVE before the Opus review returns a non-BLOCK verdict
- ALWAYS capture the test baseline **once per run, at the orchestrator, before the first CVE is worked** — on both paths, `vuln-fixer` never capturing one of its own; and where that capture returns `RUN_FAILED` or `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`, **ask the operator rather than deciding it** (Step 3), before anything is branched or edited and while a baseline can still be taken. A `NO_TESTS` capture is not that state and is never asked about
- ALWAYS pass the captured baseline block back to `vuln-fixer` on `phase: verify-resume`
- NEVER read a verify report as a pass while its `### New failures` list is non-empty — a New failure moves no `test-baseliner` `Status`, so `OK` and `PARTIAL` are both reachable with a red suite (`dev-workflows:test-baseliner` verify step 6). The list is read **beside** the `Status`, never instead of it: the `Status` arm's own return stands, the failures are named test by test in the Step 4 `Notes` cell, and the CVE finishes `clean_finish: false`
- ALWAYS run Step 3.9 (`finish-code-branch`, per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/code-handoff.md`) after a CVE's last fixer return — the commit is prompt-free (§1 rule 5), §2.4's choice is asked once and reused for every later CVE **except where one of §2.4's own two triggers re-asks it**, and a CVE whose fix is on disk is never left uncommitted
- NEVER let `vuln-fixer` commit, push, or open a pull request — it creates the branch and applies the fix; the orchestrator owns the handoff, because the consent choice behind it is one a subagent cannot ask
- NEVER push the **code repo** directly to `main` / `master` — always use the dedicated fix branch (`agents/vuln-fixer.md`), one per CVE, branched from the base and not from the previous CVE's branch (Step 3). This binds the code repo only: the specs-repo steps above push `$SPECS_PATH`'s bounded artifact paths to the specs repo's own branch (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §3.4 / §4), and never force-push (§1 rule 4)
- ALWAYS run `specs-preflight` at Step 0 and `commit-artifacts` as the run's last action (per `workflows-core:specs-repo-git`) — bounded to `$SPECS_PATH`'s artifact paths (§2.1) and to plugin-created branches (§2.2), always `git -C "$SPECS_PATH"` and never a `cd` (§1 rule 1), never force-pushing, and never failing the run
- After the run, suggest **`/compact`** (a big non-pipeline run) per `workflows-core:session-hygiene` §3 — compact-only, no clear/resume pointer; guidance only, never auto-run.
