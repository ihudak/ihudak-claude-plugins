"""Validate every plugin manifest and marketplace catalog in this repository.

Guards the three defects that have actually shipped from this repo more than
once:

  1. An over-long plugin ``description``. GitHub Copilot CLI rejects a
     marketplace whose ``plugins[i].description`` exceeds 1024 characters, and
     it rejects the WHOLE catalog -- every plugin in the marketplace then fails
     to install or update, not just the offending one. Claude Code enforces no
     such limit, so the Claude editions can drift far past it with no local
     symptom and then break the Copilot edition at port time. Trimmed by hand
     three times in the Copilot edition before this check existed; each trim
     reset the length without stopping the growth that caused it.

  2. Version drift between a plugin's own ``plugin.json`` and the marketplace
     catalog entry that advertises it. They are independent files kept in sync
     by hand; a release that bumps one and forgets the other ships a catalog
     pointing at the wrong version. Has shipped four times.

  3. A plugin manifest with no catalog entry at all. Every check above is
     forward-only: it starts from a ``marketplace.json`` entry and asks
     whether the ``plugin.json`` it names exists. Nothing asked the reverse --
     whether every ``plugin.json`` under the repository is named by some
     catalog. A plugin built this way (a valid manifest, no row in any
     ``marketplace.json``) passed every gate and shipped to nobody, because
     Claude Code and Copilot CLI both install only what a catalog advertises.

  4. Two plugin manifests declaring the same ``name``. Not a shipped incident
     but a disproved claim: a plan for this repository's own five-plugin split
     asserted this was already structurally enforced, and a review built a
     fixture -- two directories both declaring ``"name": "dupname"`` -- and
     watched it validate clean. ``manifests[name] = (...)`` was a plain dict
     assignment, so the second directory silently overwrote the first's entry;
     ``advertised`` is a ``set[str]``, so a catalog entry naming either
     directory read as satisfied either way. A ``plugin.json`` copy-pasted
     from another plugin and never given its own ``name`` would collide
     invisibly, and nothing would catch it.

Note on what is deliberately NOT checked: the ``description`` in a catalog
entry and in the matching ``plugin.json`` are not required to be identical.
They are independently authored in practice -- Copilot's ``prose-style``
blurbs, for instance, share no wording at all -- so an equality check would
fail on correct content. The half-fix it might have caught (Copilot's
marketplace trimmed to 964 while its plugin.json stayed at 2091) is already
caught by applying the length check to both files.

It also enforces the repo-root instruction budget: ``CLAUDE.md`` fails above 40,000
characters and warns above 36,000, and each ``.claude/rules/*.md`` warns above 20,000.
And it checks that every ``.claude/rules/*.md`` declares a non-empty ``paths:`` frontmatter
list whose every glob matches at least one file, so a rule that would load into every
session, or a glob left dead by a rename, fails the build instead of surviving unnoticed.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/validate-catalog.py [REPO_ROOT ...]
    python3 scripts/validate-catalog.py --selftest

With no arguments, validates the repository containing this script. Exits 0
when everything passes, 1 on any error. Warnings alone do not fail the run.

``--selftest`` builds a minimal catalog in a temporary directory, mutates it once
per failure mode, and asserts both the exit status and WHICH error was reported.
Its two siblings under ``scripts/`` have had one for releases; this one did not,
so nothing proved it could still fail -- and a checker that cannot be shown to
fail proves nothing when it passes. Asserting the message rather than the exit
code alone is deliberate: every mutation here trips a non-zero exit, so exit
status alone would let a mutation that broke a DIFFERENT rule register as
success, which is exactly how the sibling gate's selftest went green over a real
regression.

# check-docs.sh --selftest scaffolding: it names no real, installable plugin and is
# deliberately absent from every marketplace.json. Without an exclusion the reverse
# "every manifest is advertised" assertion below fires on it, reporting a defect that
# does not exist.
#
# This is a PATH prefix, not a SKIP_DIRS entry, and the distinction is load-bearing.
# SKIP_DIRS matches a bare directory NAME at any depth, which is safe for `.git` and
# `node_modules` -- names nothing legitimate is ever called -- but "fixtures" is a
# common word. As a SKIP_DIRS entry it silently hid any manifest nested under a
# directory named `fixtures` anywhere in the tree, including a real plugin's own test
# corpus, from BOTH directions of the advertisement check. Anchored here instead, it
# excludes exactly the one directory it was written for.
# A git worktree at `.worktrees/<name>/` (or `worktrees/<name>/`) is a SECOND FULL COPY
# of the tree, so every plugin name in it appears twice and the uniqueness assertion
# below reports one ERROR per plugin -- measured at 10 errors and 3 warnings on a tree
# with one worktree present. The copy is git-ignored (`/.worktrees/` in .gitignore) and
# is never what this gate is asked about. It matters beyond the annoyance: the
# merged-result gate run is the last check before a branch lands, it runs from the main
# checkout while the worktree is still on disk, and it fails there for a reason that has
# nothing to do with the merge -- at the precise moment someone is deciding whether the
# merge was sound. Both names are excluded because both are what the worktree tooling
# creates; only `.worktrees` is in this repo's .gitignore today.
#
# Root-anchored for exactly the reason the `fixtures` exclusion above is: `worktrees` is
# an ordinary word, and a bare name-match at any depth would hide a real manifest nested
# under any directory that happened to be called that. The selftest pins the anchoring
# with a pair -- a copy under the root's own `.worktrees/` passes, an identical one under
# a `worktrees` directory further down is still rejected.
