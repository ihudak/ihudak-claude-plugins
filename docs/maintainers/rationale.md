# Rationale — the evidence behind the repository's rules

Never auto-loaded. Each section holds the measured cases, refused widenings and history behind one rule in `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/rules/`, each linking back here by a `why` reference to its matching `#<slug>` heading. Read a section before proposing to change its rule. Figures marked *(as of d5f3034b)* were true on that commit and have not been re-derived.

## description-budget

The limit is GitHub Copilot CLI's, and it rejects the **whole catalog** — one over-long blurb makes every plugin in the marketplace fail to install or update.

Claude Code enforces no limit, which is exactly why over-long blurbs kept shipping: the Claude editions grew unchecked and the Copilot edition inherited the overflow at port time. The blurb reached 2788 chars by appending one sentence per release, and was trimmed by hand three times in the Copilot edition before the check existed.

## id-grammar

A dash-separated ID has the shape of a Jira issue key, so pasting a PRD, ARD, or Epic draft into Jira auto-links it to an unrelated real ticket in any project sharing the prefix, and a wiki-style importer rewrites it into a triple-bracketed wikilink on export. <!-- vendor-token-ok: names the tracker whose autolinking is the hazard the requirement-ID grammar exists to avoid; the rule is unexplainable without it -->

The exit code alone was not enough and this was proven rather than assumed: each negative fixture carries several violating lines, so any surviving alternation holds the exit at 1, and a review deleted both `SM-C` alternations, watched `--selftest` print PASS, and then watched the degraded gate accept a live bracketed legacy counter-metric ID in a shipped reference file. `scripts/validate-catalog.py` now carries a `--selftest` of its own for the same reason.

The `id-grammar-ok` census was five such lines across five files *(as of d5f3034b)* (one accepts the legacy form as a tolerant reader — `workflows-core:ard-resolution`; the other four are the reviewers that check identifier integrity and must quote the form they reject). **The count fell from ten when the tracker-reading agent that held five of them was deleted.**

## docs-tree

Deriving every claim on a page from the thing that runs it is how the restructure found six defects the README had been asserting for releases.

No case count is stated for `check-docs.sh --selftest` because it changes every time a check gains a failure mode, and the two readings of it (cases that mutate a copy, and cases in total) differ by the unmutated-fixture pass — so a count is a claim that goes stale in the same commit that improves the gate. The `CLAUDE.md` sentence that stated it asserted 37 while the tree had 39, and was then corrected to a number the correcting commit's own diff had already moved.

## number-gating

`check-docs.sh` check 9 gates seven sentences **per gated plugin**, and every one of them lives under that plugin's own tree — none is in `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/rules/`. Some of their inventory numbers (each plugin's slash commands, subagents, skills and hooks) have a counterpart sentence in a file check 9 does gate, so a tree change turns the build red somewhere and prompts the edit in `CLAUDE.md` or the rules file; every other number in them — the documentation-page totals, `check-docs.sh`'s own check count, both marker tallies, and the caller and consumer counts — has no counterpart anywhere and is held by hand alone.

A count taken off the prose it was meant to check agrees with that prose by construction and tells nobody anything, and it is at its most convincing exactly when the finding beside it is right. **The case is `CLAUDE.md`'s own**: a branch reported a released changelog entry as claiming *eleven* states where it says *ten* and lists ten, having read a 660-character window centred on another word, met it mid-way at *"n-state gate"*, and completed it from memory — from `CLAUDE.md`, which does say eleven, about today's table. The rendering was read for the thing, the gap filled from a belief about the current tree, and nothing beside it was wrong.

## check-10

Check 10 enforces the identity quarantine; before that check existed two per-command pages linked a sibling plugin by full container URL and survived releases, found only by hand. The binding reason is **forks**: a hardcoded container URL is wrong in anyone's fork.

Check 10 matches its tokens on word boundaries, not as substrings: an unanchored match produced 38 failures on correct pages when the marketplace was renamed to a word another identifier contains, and a gate a fork must disable is a gate a fork does not have.

`getting-started.md` is the single sanctioned exception to the identity quarantine, which is why it carries the install commands inline instead of linking out.

## check-11

What check 11 excludes is stated because a reader who assumes otherwise reintroduces a shipped defect.

The widening census lives only in `workflows-core:next-phase-offer`'s scope-paragraph section. The `CLAUDE.md` sentence stating the rule used to carry its own copy of the site count, naming `/document`, `/implement`, `/specify` and `/idea`, and the reference file carried a second copy naming three of those four — both true when written, both stale within two increments as commands moved plugins, and disagreeing with each other in the meantime. The rule that would have prevented that is the one the rule now follows: re-measure in one place, cite it everywhere else.

## check-12

Check 12's parser is **bracket-matched and quote-aware, not a non-greedy regex**, and that is the whole point: `choices:\s*\[(.*?)\]` stops at a `]` inside an option string and silently skips that array, which is how the census that motivated the check missed three live arrays, two of them six-option.

## stop-routing-no-check

Matching the stop-ID condition suffix (`BRD_SPLIT_EMPTY_INVENTORY` → `PRD_GROUND_EMPTY_INVENTORY`) fires 7 times on content that is correct, because a stop legitimately names a command to warn against it (“do not run …, which stops on the same emptiness” — though both instances of exactly that wording, in `/brd-split`'s full-mode stop and `/brd-interview`'s, proved false on 2026-09-23, `/prd-ground` refusing each folder before it reads any inventory, which is the point about stop texts made again) or names it against a *different* key (`<PARENT-KEY>`); silencing those needs three hand-tuned filters, after which it fires on nothing and would have caught none of the eleven route defects that motivated it. “Names the emitting command itself” fires 11 times, all correct (`re-run '/product-workflows:brd-split <KEY>'` on a bad key). “Names no exit at all” fires 14 times, all correct (a dirty tree, a prompt leak, a schema boundary — the remedy is not a command). What the eleven actually shared is a claim about another command's *behaviour* in a state, which no file states.

## check-13

Vendor neutrality was a hard constraint held by prose alone until it was not. The marker convention already existed with exactly one user and no enforcer.

**The narrow token set is evidence, not taste, and is recorded so the widening is not re-proposed:** the tracker names fire on 13 sites, of which 3 were real defects (the plugin README claiming `/ready` verifies a Jira status when it is artifact-anchored and reads no tracker; `docs/commands/vuln.md` twice calling `/vuln`'s optional address — a key resolved against `$SPECS_PATH` — a Jira ID) and 10 correct content, now marked. <!-- vendor-token-ok: quotes the two shipped defects check 13 was created to remove, which cannot be cited without naming the token they carried -->

Adding the git-forge names fires on **70 further sites, every one correct and none a defect** — host classification, CLI capability facts, and rules forbidding REST calls: a forge is something the plugin stands in front of and must name to behave correctly, a tracker is something it deliberately does not read. That is the same fires-only-on-correct-content result on which check 11's widening was measured and rejected twice.

**Its scope is every text file, not just markdown, and the widening was measured before it was made.** A tracker name leaks as readily through `plugin.json`'s user-visible `description` or a hook-script comment as through prose — the argument its sibling check 14 already makes for reading everything — and scoped to `*.md` it could see neither. Measured first, as this repo requires of any widening: 17 non-markdown text files under the plugin, and the widened scan fires on **none** of them, which is why this widening was taken where check 11's (which fired only on correct content) was twice rejected.

Six of the fourteen marked lines sat in `workflows-core` *(as of d5f3034b)*, so the census recipe reads `plugins` rather than one plugin. The older `| grep -v '/CHANGELOG.md:'` filter silently dropped the `CLAUDE.md` sentence describing it from its own audit, because the sentence quoted the filter.

## check-14

Check 14's token list is stored base64-encoded for one reason worth stating plainly: a denylist written in clear text would itself put the names into the tree, making the gate the only violation of the rule it enforces and every future `grep` come back dirty. It has zero live sites — the tree and its history are both clean — so it exists to keep a constraint that currently holds by discipline from quietly stopping to hold. It was added after a review mutated a docs page with those names and watched check 13 pass, which is also the correction to the belief that check 13 covered them: it never did.

## check-15

**Check 15 gates index membership** — every command must appear in `docs/README.md`, in the plugin README, and inside `docs/workflow.md`'s **mermaid diagram**, asserted separately from the page because prose below a diagram is where a command lands when someone adds it in a hurry. Check 4 proves a command has a page and check 3 proves that page is reachable from *some* page; neither proves it is findable, and a review demonstrated the gap by deleting a command from all four listing surfaces and watching the build stay green. The defect that actually shipped this way was the same shape and smaller: `/frames` reached the workflow page's prose but not its diagram, under an opening sentence promising "every command shown here".

## check-16

The loader contract is the trade the split made explicit: the shared reference corpus lives in `workflows-core`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to the *reading* plugin, and a dependent plugin therefore reaches every reference through one argument-taking skill rather than through 28 named wrappers — one skill whose argument nothing validates unless something does.

Each of the three citation forms is load-bearing for a different file: the **bare** form is the only thing reaching `dependencies.md`, while the **plugin-root** form is the only reason `instruction-file-maintenance.md`, `handoff/code-scanner.md` and `handoff/impl-maintenance.md` are not reported as dead, since each is read by one of core's own agents by path.

No file outside core cites a core reference by path in either of the two forms that resolve to the reading plugin — the defect the loader exists to prevent, gated only over `commands/`, `agents/` and `references/` because widening it to the whole plugin fires once, on correct content, which is the result on which two earlier widenings were refused. **Scope is `commands/`, `agents/` and `references/`, measured rather than chosen**: within them the preamble relation is an **exact** match — every file that cites, carries — while a comparable number of files outside them cite a core reference and correctly carry none, so an unscoped implementation fires on every one of those on a clean tree. **All four of those figures live in `scripts/check-docs.sh`'s check-16 header and nowhere else, deliberately**: the `CLAUDE.md` sentence describing check 16 carried a second copy of them, both copies went stale, and the rule stated with check 11 — re-measure in one place, cite it everywhere else — is the one that would have prevented it — and admitting `docs/` as a *citation source* would make the reverse direction unfalsifiable, since core's own `docs/reference/references.md` enumerates every reference file by name.

## check-17

A ledger item (PS15) recorded a live defect: an agent self-disclosed dispatching a stray subagent mid-run, outside its own sanctioned set. Verifying *runtime* behaviour is impossible from a static script, and a check that merely asserted "the rule exists" would have passed on the very run that misbehaved: **measured first**, only 3 of the agents under `PLUGIN_RELS` carried `Task` in their tool list at all (`upgrade-executor`, `vuln-fixer`, `docs-style-checker`), and all three already carried a NEVER-dispatch rule naming their sanctioned subagent, in near-identical wording, when one of them still mis-dispatched. That is 3-for-3 today *(as of d5f3034b)* — green on the current tree — and it fires the moment a fourth agent gains `Task` without the rule, which is the realistic way this decays. **The reverse direction is asserted too**, the same call checks 8 and 11 already made for their own declared-vs-observed pairs: an agent carrying the rule but not `Task` declares a dispatch authority the harness would refuse, which is stale and misleading — verified green on the same three-file tree before it shipped.

## check-18

A gate that fired on both the red case and its green twin would be red for the life of every release branch, and a gate that blocks correct work is a gate someone disables. **The recurrence is what bought it**: commit 47050554 dated every such section on 2026-09-19 and said so in its message, and by 2026-09-22 seven more stood across four plugins, all live on origin. Matching the bare `## [Unreleased]` form would fire on correct content and nothing else, the same result on which earlier widenings of `check-docs.sh` were refused.

## check-19

The organisation's name and its internal repositories were named by the design archive and its neighbouring records across more than a hundred files until they were swept out on 2026-09-23. The denylist is encoded because a clear-text denylist would be the one violation of its own rule.

## mermaid-gate

The rule exists because GitHub draws each ```` ```mermaid ```` block as a diagram and shows *"Unable to render rich display"* where it does not parse.

Until `scripts/mermaid/check-mermaid.mjs` existed nothing in this repository parsed mermaid (`check-docs.sh` check 15 extracts diagrams, but only to test which commands appear in one). `plugins/product-workflows/docs/workflow.md` shipped from product-workflows 3.0.0 onward with five unquoted edge labels carrying `[BR#n]`, `[CG#n]/[DG#n]` and `[AC#n]/[FR#n]`, which mermaid reads as the start of a node shape; a person found it by opening the page.

**Its first version used a hand-rolled fence scanner, and a release review found three kinds of diagram GitHub draws that it never saw** — inside a blockquote, on a list-marker line, and after a line opening with a backtick code span — plus a four-space-indented block it wrongly rejected.

A failure is located by content because mermaid numbers its errors from text it has already rewritten, and a replay of those rewrites is never complete: the gate's second version tried one and pointed confidently at the wrong line after a decision node. The parser was calibrated against a real headless render of the repository's tree, where the two agreed block for block.

## choices-arity

The plugin nonetheless shipped a convention saying the opposite of the harness schema (2–4 options, no authored Other), stated across the command files (*"last choice is always `"Other… (describe)"`"*), which authored duplicate options in bulk and pushed dozens of arrays past the cap — the measured figures are in `scripts/check-docs.sh`'s check-12 header, cited rather than restated in `CLAUDE.md` because two copies of one census is how they came to disagree while `workflows-core:escalation-rules` simultaneously required every array be presented verbatim — a rule the harness made unfollowable. **Two consequences outlive the cleanup** (both stated in `CLAUDE.md`). Six closed-vocabulary pickers used to protect themselves by omitting the free-text option.

The harness's schema is the authority on the arity, not the plugin's taste. A five-option array is not a long prompt — it is a tool call rejected at validation, so the run cannot present it at all. Of the four customer-authority pickers, three used to omit the free-text option and `/brd-reconcile`'s conflicting-answer picker never could; normalising a free-text answer there, never writing it through, is where D14's protection now lives. The next-phase-offer overflow rule's full menu in prose is already that file's "universal minimum". The epic-picker's directory-listing case is the one no static check can see, because a PRD with four Epics overflows an array that has no literal options to count.

Verbatim presentation binds every command of the family, not only `/document` and `/epics`. The two rules are one rule — verbatim presentation and the arity rule: an array the harness cannot render is an array no orchestrator can present verbatim, which is what the retired "last choice is always `Other… (describe)`" convention produced.

## code-handoff-citation

The code-oriented commands' not-clean-finish invariant cites `code-handoff`'s *A run that did not end clean* by heading rather than by number: it read §2.8 from 3.10.0, where that was right, until 3.12.0 inserted `### 2.7 The title and the body file` above that section and shifted every later section by one — and a stale §-citation is invisible to a §-existence sweep, because it resolves, to the wrong section.

## implement-phase-3-5

The `/implement` invariant that Phase 3.5 **names what it did not cover rather than assuming it** is the honest form of the "full test suite is verified" that invariant used to claim in `CLAUDE.md`, a claim three reachable completions denied — the three the invariant now lists.

## test-writing-requirement

Changing the tree to meet an unqualified first clause of the test-writing requirement was the alternative and was rejected: it would have to remove **both** escapes a user can choose — *"Accept the remaining failures and proceed"* and Pre-Phase 3.5's *"Skip tests for this run"* — and a gate-failed run that cannot finish is a run that leaves the implementation uncommitted, which `dev-workflows:code-handoff` §1 rule 5 exists to prevent. The completions nobody chooses are not options to remove at all: a suite that will not start is the environment's answer, not the operator's.

The silent fourth member of kind 2 — a runner that narrows its own run past the test `test-writer` just wrote — was measured on Mocha 12.0.2, which does not default `--forbid-only` from `CI` (`dev-workflows:test-baseliner` capture step 1 draws that distinction per runner, and names the runners that abort instead): with an `it.only` already committed in the repository, `CI=true npm test` printed `1 passing` and exited 0 both before the run wrote a failing spec beside it and after.

## brd-recut-readers

The sibling re-cut rule names no recipe for its readers because the recipe that stood in its `CLAUDE.md` bullet was wrong. That recipe — `grep -l unallocated plugins/product-workflows/commands/brd-*.md` — returns six files and is wrong in both directions: `/brd-proposal` is in it and reads neither §3.2 nor the re-cut (its one `§3.2` is `workflows-core:phase-handoff`'s), and `/brd-intake` is in it citing §3.2 only to say it offers no re-cut, while `/create-prd`, `/create-ard`, `/specify` and `/prd-ground` each cite `coverage-ledger-format` §3.2 by name for a disposition the re-cut leaves behind and are all outside the glob.

## addressing-fallback-totals

The "twelve files, eleven commands" totals the `workflows-core:addressing` §7 bullet in `CLAUDE.md` used to tell readers to re-derive went false twice — cutting the tracker moved them without moving the number, and by 2026-09-23 the commands citing §7 did so for other reasons — `/brd-split` for its *Adoption is additive* rule, `/release-notes` to say why it has a row — and none to reach the fallback, while `/implement`, `/vuln` and `/brd-proposal` resolved through §3 with no row — so §7 now keeps none.

A regression in the shared fallback reaches `/epics`, `/design` and `/ready`, which have nothing to do with BRDs.

## prose-style-roles

**The `CLAUDE.md` sentence stating `docs-workflows`' style-gate dependency used to call the dispatch a fallback gated on the rungs failing**, which left the ordinary case — a repo whose Vale run succeeds, where the checker runs anyway as the complementary semantic pass — unstated.

## docs-grounding-flags

`/idea` was the only implementation of `--no-docs` / `--docs <path>` until the other eight consumers were given a flag-stripping rung, four of which had none at all and would have read the flag as a positional token.

## release-notes-worthiness

`/release-notes` once read the PRD's own `relevant_for_release_notes` and stopped on an explicit `false` or `no`. Every PRD is relevant for release notes, so the field asked a question with one answer and the only value that changed anything was one nobody should write.

## recipe-returns-wrong-answer

**Match the execution phrase, not the bare name.** The recipe that stood in `CLAUDE.md`'s `specs-repo-git` paragraph was `grep -l commit-artifacts plugins/*/commands/*.md`, and it returns thirty: `/docs-serve`'s only two occurrences of that string are its rule never to run it, so the bare-name grep counts a negative mention as a caller. A recipe that returns a wrong answer is worse than a stale count, because the next reader trusts what it returns.

The `prose-formatting` consumer sentence in `CLAUDE.md` named nine consumers and missed `/prd-proposal` and `/brd-proposal`, which is why it now carries the recipe instead. The `finding-triage` consumer list omitted the two proposal commands until its grep was run against it.

## plugin-root-expansion

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`'s expansion in slash-command bodies was verified in a live run by typing the slash command and comparing the received body against the file on disk: all 33 literal tokens in `docs-workflows`'s `document.md` arrived as absolute paths. The substitution is specific to this variable, which is what makes it a harness feature rather than general expansion: `${DOCS_PATH:-/workspace/docs}` and `${REPOS_PATH:-/workspace}` arrived **literal** in the same body. **`CLAUDE.md` previously claimed the opposite**, and that claim was the stated reason the `model-routing` skill exists; the claim is retired, the skill is not.

## one-key-namespace

The rule that stood in `CLAUDE.md` forbade widening a *tracker-side* check to accept three segments, on the grounds that no tracker mints a three-segment key; with no tracker read by any command, every check is folder-side and the defect family it guarded against cannot occur. **What survives is the reason, not the rule** — the autolink detector's narrowness, which the rule in `CLAUDE.md` now states.

## resolve-against-a-known-set

All five sites of 3.3.0's longest-running defect family are this: four re-stated a key grammar locally instead of citing the one `workflows-core:addressing` §1 fixes, so the copies drifted apart and a valid slice key hard-stopped a command its own recommended redirect sent it to; the fifth extracted a key out of a branch name.

Candidates come from the set, so nothing in a branch name can *become* a key and slug text can never be captured — where the obvious widened regex `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*(-[0-9]+)+` reads `PRODUCT-1234-2` out of `spec/PRODUCT-1234-2fa-rollout`.

A key re-derived by pattern is a key nothing in the tree ever asserted.

## claim-expiry-sweep

Eleven such sentences were retired in 3.3.0, sitting in ten files — four commands, three references and three documentation pages — and the count grew from six to eleven only because successive agents walked the tree instead of trusting the list they were handed.

The eight subsections below hold the evidence for the refinements the sibling re-cut paid for, and the rounds after it — each one bought by a review finding what the sweep had already walked past, which is why the refinement list carries no count of its own.

Nothing gates such sentences: they are ordinary prose, invisible to every script in `scripts/`. A sentence that named the absence as its reason for an offer needs a new reason because the state a run leaves is usually still a real constraint on what it can honestly offer next.

### refinement-1

One sweep landed in the right paragraph, read the sentence its own term matched, found it true and moved on — leaving two sentences beside it that the same change had falsified, in a command body an agent executes in order.

### refinement-2

The two most expensive misses on that branch contained none of the swept phrases at all; one was found only by reading Phase 0 in sequence, and a later task's end-to-end read turned up five more the same way.

### refinement-3

The exclusivity probe was missing through six task reviews, and two Important findings survived to the whole-branch review because of it.

The five phrases were shown to be a starting set, not the vocabulary, on the 2026-09-22 whole-tree pass: four of six independent slices reported the same gap, and two of that pass's confirmed defects were reachable only past it. One slice's supplementary probe over the same files returned **44 further matches**; another's returned 29, one of which was the second site of a defect whose first site the five had found, so fixing on the five alone would have left a copy standing.

Three wider rounds followed (2026-09-22/23), the second finding more than the first; what they ran and found, and what round 3's reviews deferred, is in `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-09-23-exclusivity-probe-wider-vocabulary.md`.

The exclusivity probe matters because that is where a falsified claim hides when it names none of the vocabulary the change introduced.

### refinement-4

The family's shared authorities live in `workflows-core`, so a per-plugin recipe cannot see them: `workflows-core:next-phase-offer` — the file `.claude/rules/gates.md` § Check 11 names as the authority for the offer convention and for check 11's family derivation — carried a claim the re-cut falsified in both directions, and `workflows-core:phase-handoff` §3.4 kept an unqualified no-op claim the branch had corrected at four sites inside its own plugin. Both reached the final review untouched because the design's own sweep recipe was written as a grep over one plugin's commands and was structurally blind to everything else. The two root files were bought the same way, one round later: a review found that round's worst claim — the repo-root `README.md` selling a `gh auth` step for a diff-reading capability neither command has — in a file every recipe written in `CLAUDE.md` scoped past, while `CLAUDE.md` had been swept only because each ruling named it by hand.

Keeping `CHANGELOG.md` in the sweep was measured before deciding, as this repo requires of any scope change: **25 of the 67 defects review passes A22–A28 and B22–B28 recorded are sited in a changelog** — the highest-yield single surface in the tree, ahead of `docs/` at 15 and `references/` at 13 — so keeping them in fires on defective content at a higher rate than any other file class, which is the opposite of the fires-only-on-correct-content result on which check 11's widening was refused twice. Nor is the file unread by the build — check 14 reads every text file in the repository, changelogs included, and a mutation of one fires it, so "no gate opens a changelog" is false as well as beside the point. `scratchpad/r47/sweep.py`, the instrument refinement 7 names, carries no such exclusion; two of this branch's citation resolvers did copy the gates' filename filter — one wrong phase citation was sitting in a changelog while they ran, in a file neither could open.

Widening the scope is only half of it: four more of that citation's family were written into the same changelog later, and an existence check would have passed all five however wide its scope, because every one named `Phase 12` of a command that had a Phase 12. They were caught by reading the phase they cited — the axis, not the scope. **Reading the phase proves containment, not uniqueness**, and the difference is worth carrying: slicing the phase a citation names and finding the cited thing inside it falsifies a citation that is simply wrong, which is what a `Phase 12`-exists check cannot do — but it does not prove the cited thing is only there, so a phrase living in two phases passes under either citation. And where one command file carries two modes over the same phase numbers, the reader has to pick the mode before slicing: `/document`'s `# Mode A` and `# Mode B` each carry a `## Phase 3`, one reading the PRD folder and one implementing a direct edit. Picking the wrong mode reports a miss rather than a false pass, which is the safe direction — but that is a property of this failure mode, not of the check.

The scope clause binds a human or agent sweep and moves no gate's scope: `check-docs.sh` check 10 still leaves the root README alone, for its own unrelated reason. `check-id-grammar.sh` and `check-docs.sh` checks 12, 13, 16 and 19 do exclude `CHANGELOG.md` by filename, each for the one stated reason that **history keeps the retired form it shipped with** — which exempts a *quotation* and nothing else: a count, a line citation, a phase name or a claim about today's tree goes stale in an entry exactly as it does in a command, and that is most of what an entry is.

### refinement-5

The round that corrected the repo-matching claim in a `getting-started.md` page and a reference layout block swept both root files thoroughly on the *other* axis it was fixing — its commit message says so — and left the repo-root `README.md`'s two copies of the corrected claim standing, so the scope was honoured and the trigger was not, because nothing had landed. The instinct to sweep the phrasing just rewritten, taken alone, is what left a sixth copy standing.

### refinement-6

A sweep for *"no agent reads `$REPOS_PATH`"* cannot reach *"`code-scanner` resolves repositories under it"*, and one for *"there is no `pull_requests[]`"* cannot reach *"resolves the pull requests named there"*, which is how two corrections each shipped beside an uncorrected twin — one on the sibling page the corrected page links to, one in the corrected page itself.

### refinement-7

**The two measurements behind the addition-count rule disagree about whether one delimiter is enough, which is why it states a property and not a character count.** On the edit that added a wrapper alternation to the `test-notify` gate, one delimiter on each side suffices: the body `mvn test|gradlew test|…|make test` still returns 1 with `mvnw test|` inserted ahead of it, and returns 1 again on a fixture appending `|cargo test` instead — the second case being why the opening `(` is not enough on its own, since an insertion lands at either edge. On the edit that inserted five rows into `test-baseliner`'s parse table it does not, because there the delimiter bounds every row rather than the edit: the `Gradle` row alone returns 1 before and 1 after, that row with one character on each side returns 1 and 1 as well, and only the `Gradle` row *plus the `pytest` row that had followed it* falls 1 → 0.

Measured over `commands/` and `references/`, a 17-character phrase survives the wrap break about six times in seven, but an 80-character one only about one time in three — so at sentence length a line-based grep misses an occurrence more often than it finds one, and the short count it reports is plausible rather than obviously wrong, which is what makes it dangerous on exactly the files refinement 7 exists for. The reviews on this branch ran the three-step method as `scratchpad/r47/sweep.py`, a session-local script this repo does not ship and which collapses the file but not the pattern.

Reading the paragraph is not enough either, and this was bought twice in one round and once more by the round that wrote the refinement: the round that corrected `between the three` to `between the four` in `workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.3 had read that paragraph and left the identical string standing further down the same section, in the paragraph saying the array is not reworded for a missing remote — next to a second falsified count on that same line — while scoping *"the one reader a proposal has"* on six surfaces and leaving it on two more, one of them the §1 of the very reference whose §0 it had just made the census, and the other an instruction telling the run to **print** the retired sentence; then the round that wrote refinement 7 certified it with a count of that same string taken on the parent tree, publishing **3** in a commit whose own new prose quoted it — as this rationale section still does. One wrap-insensitive count per edited string, taken after the edit rather than before it, catches every one of those; no other refinement on the list does, because each of the others tells you where to look and this one tells you when you are done.

A replacement changes text *inside* the span you counted, so the after-count falls however the query was framed, while an addition changes text only at that span's boundary and leaves the string standing inside the new form *by design*. A line-based `grep -c` over hard-wrapped files returns a number smaller than the truth with nothing to say it did. The three-step method is the rule, not any script: write your own and keep the method.

### refinement-8

**Two instances of the miss itself, one caught and one missed, which is what makes the pair evidence.** Correcting a probe's `git log` from *"the token"* to the run's whole token set falsified two changelog copies carrying the singular, and a sweep built on the **subject** found both in the same round. Narrowing a fallback's listing — so that a commit accounted for by the block recording it gets no line of its own — falsified six copies, and a sweep anchored on **one known site's wording** — the query string `that date rule dropped`, which exactly one of the five carried, the others varying enough that the round fixing them needed four different per-site strings — reached five and missed the sixth, a `docs/` page stating the same claim with a different noun. **And once prospectively, which is the one kind of evidence those two cannot supply**, both being reconstructions of misses already made: refinement 8 sent a reader to the distant copies of a claim the branch had just narrowed, and one was there — `dev-workflows`' released 2.52.0 entry still saying in the present tense what `phase-handoff` §4.1 *defines*, falsified by the count change one round earlier and sitting in a changelog nobody had reopened. **Recorded once and not added to**: a refinement that logged every later find would become a changelog of itself, and the point is made by one.

The `docs/` copies need remembering, not a wider scope: refinement 4's scope already covers those pages. The second instance above is what anchoring a sweep on a noun costs.

Refinement 8 says which strings to count; refinement 7 says when you are done counting them. **Copies vary in wording site by site, including among the ones you already hold**, which is the whole reason the query is built on the subject; and one noun across every copy is worth a little precision because a second noun is a copy the next sweep cannot see.

## sentence-context

**The risk peaks where a reader would least expect it**: of the four instances one batch's records carry, **three were introduced by fixes to earlier findings**, so the move is likeliest exactly when someone is already being careful about a rule they have just been shown to have got wrong.

**Four surfaces, one move.** A **trigger**'s extent is the worked example below. A **rationale**'s is the second. A **report condition**'s is the third: a Final Report asked for `workflows-core:phase-handoff` §4.1's outcome line *on every run*, where a producer that never offers a handoff — `/frames` having written no index, `/idea` on `status: draft`, `/implement`'s Phase 4.5 no-op, the live cases §4.1 itself lists — has no line to print and would have had to assert a decline nobody was asked about; the widened condition reached all three of §4.1's outcome states, not the two the report line was written for. And the fourth is the same move at **sentence** scale: a gloss widened to say what else an option drops asserted *save one*, a count the run cannot make where the set may be none, one or many.

**The trigger surface in full, because it is the clearest.** The array is the cheap half of such a change; the expensive half is every sentence around it that says what an option *does*, each written when only the old trigger could reach that question and free to assume whatever that trigger guaranteed. **Measured**, as an Important regression on its branch: `/brd-intake`'s same-or-new question gained a second trigger — a matched pair whose two anchors name one element without their text being the same — with no condition on the file's recorded state, while *Same requirement*'s stated effect kept the existing row whole, its anchor and its existing `text` with it. That effect was written for the unmatched-row case, where the file is recorded **unchanged** and the existing text is still what the document says; on a file Phase 2 recorded **replaced** it would have kept text the revised document no longer carries. The array was right and its options were right — the paragraph stating the effect was not, and it is the one a change that reads only the array never opens. It now turns on the file's recorded state: on a replaced file the option keeps the id, takes the returned `text` and reports the change old → new.

**The rationale surface** — `pass9a-1-report.md` counts two of that batch's last three findings as this: a **rationale** clause added for a new rule, landing beside an older sentence written when the rule was narrower, where the instruction stays correct and the reason beside it goes false. In `/brd-intake` a carve-out gained a clause saying a revised document can make the agent start returning a row it had not returned, two clauses from a standing claim that the agent is handed the same inputs on every later run; sweeping that claim found a twin one paragraph away resting a prediction on the same premise. **A third site kept the claim unqualified and was right to**, being the re-dispatch *within one run*, where nothing the agent is handed can change. On qualifying by the class: the first repair (`d2cdba1a`) named a source the customer had not revised, and it survived exactly one review round before a corrected transcription — a change to what the agent is handed with no revision behind it — falsified it; the second (`9a5599a9`) closed the class instead.

**The pointer face — one documented instance of each kind.** A `source:` ladder written from `product-workflows:brd-format` §1.1's vantage, where *this log* is the link log, was pasted into `brd/brd-figures.md`'s own layout block, where *this* re-points at the figures file — which is no log, and the opening line the instruction means is the link log's — so a writer meeting the instruction inside the block it is writing looks in the wrong file. And a clause across an em-dash read *"no later command of the route opens anything"*, where the object was the file named before the dash: read literally it is an absolute claim about every later command. **It arrived in a sentence written to repair an earlier finding** — `62c4a552`, the round-13 lead-in that gave `/brd-intake`'s one run-ending recommendation its reason where the choice is made — and the round after removed it (`19ea31f3`): the *risk peaks* claim above, counted there over the extent face alone, holds on this one too. Two instances, one check, so the pointer face stays a clause of the rule rather than a rule of its own.

**Nothing in the rule quotes `brd-intake.md` for what it says today, deliberately**: the first draft of the rule quoted it four times, and one of those quotations was falsified within a round by the batch that owns the file — the rule, in miniature, at its own expense. The instances **describe** instead, which is what that audit settled on and what keeps them checkable; the one quotation that stands is of a clause two named commits add and then remove, which `git show` settles and no later edit of that file can move.

Why the faces differ: on the extent face the sentence you wrote stays put while its neighbours go false, and it is the one you have already checked; on the pointer face the sentence you wrote is the one that goes wrong while its neighbours stay untouched, so the extent check is inert, nothing having widened and no case split existing to enumerate. The old precondition's out-of-reach paragraphs are where an assumption sits unstated precisely because nothing could once falsify it. The third-check threshold exists because three checks with their evidence will not read as one line; a face that needs a check of its own is a rule of its own.

Refinement 8 of the claim-expiry sweep fires on the same change as the extent face and covers the *other* axis — the **copies** of that claim elsewhere — so a reader who does one and not the other is half covered: the extent face is about the adjacent assumption, refinement 8 about the distant copy.

## verification-record-last

Three of the 2026-08-07 round's records went stale because the record was written first; one was falsified by its own sub-project's next commit 17 minutes later. Two of that round's wrong values propagated by copying an `expect N` from another plan.

## measure-the-population

It was learned expensively. A resolver for the pre-rename artifact filenames was triaged, measured across ten commands, specified, approved and costed at four plugins before anyone asked the one question that decided it — *how many trees hold a pre-rename artifact?* None: every finding in it was reachable only on a specs repo written before the filenames lost their keys and never renamed since, and the loop it had found between `/update-prd` and `/create-prd` needed a legacy file to exist before either command could misbehave. What shipped instead was one paragraph, because the reason the defect looked live was a promise in `workflows-core:addressing` §5 that over-reached — *"the fallback means they need never do it"* — **from which the entire resolver was derivable, and had been derived.**

Trace reachability per finding because a defect class assumed to be uniform routinely is not. The counter-case is stated so the rule is not over-applied.

## drift-risk

A refactor deleted `prd-source-resolution.md` rather than rewriting it, on the judgement that what remained was *"'resolve the folder, read `prd.md`' — two obvious lines, inlined into its two callers. Duplicating those is not the drift risk that duplicating a key grammar was."* What remained was **three** lines. The third identified the pre-rename PRD by a frontmatter field, and the commit immediately before had kept exactly that line on purpose and recorded why. Both callers lost it in the same change — one silently, one rewritten into a test for a field that had arrived in the same commit as the rename and so could never match — and the duplication then drifted into three disagreeing copies and five commands carrying none, one pair of which formed a remedy loop in which neither command could run.

## plugin-update-cli

`CLAUDE.md` named a `claude plugin reinstall` for a long time, in four places, and it does not exist: the CLI answers `error: unknown command 'reinstall'` and offers `install` and `uninstall`.

That `marketplace update` leaves installed plugins alone was measured, not assumed: after a successful `marketplace update`, `claude plugins list` still reported `docs-workflows` at `1.0.0` while the catalogue advertised `1.1.0`. **`CLAUDE.md` previously claimed the opposite** — that refreshing the marketplace "does the same thing for every plugin installed from it, in one step" — and that claim is retired. The `/plugins` interface was verified live, where it took `docs-workflows` from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 after a CLI `marketplace update` had left it at 1.0.0.

`prose-style` 0.4.0 is the release whose checker applies the specs repository's house-style rules to `/release-notes`' draft. The `/plugins` interface is a human step, which is why `CLAUDE.md`'s update section leads with the per-plugin `update` command.

An edit that "did not land" is very often a session that has not restarted since the update.

## verify-branch-before-commit

That is not hypothetical: one session branched away from `main` between two commits of another session's run, and the second commit — a fix for a release-gating defect — landed on the unrelated feature branch, where a `git push origin main` would have left it behind.

## docs-workflows-not-a-dependency

`dev-workflows` offers `/document` and `/release-notes` as next steps and `product-workflows` offers `/release-notes`, and both cite their references in prose, but load nothing from them, so a run completes whether or not `docs-workflows` is installed.

## gate-chain-exit

A trailing `echo "EXIT=$?"` prints the **chain's** status correctly — `$?` expands before the `echo` runs, and a `;` and a newline are the same separator, so neither form changes what is printed. What it does change is the *invocation's own* exit status, which becomes 0 either way: a reader who trusts the wrapper's status instead of the printed value reads a red build as green, which one round did five times before catching it. Appending nothing and letting the chain's own status stand works too.

## model-routing-fan-out

§8.5's opt-in seeded second round has its adopters named in §8.5's own *Opt-in* paragraph, not copied into `CLAUDE.md`.

## worktree-not-checkout

A duplicate commit on another session's branch is theirs to resolve and, where the content is identical, merges cleanly.
