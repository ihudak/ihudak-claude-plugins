Draft release notes for the resolved PRD: $ARGUMENTS

**Core references.** A citation of the form `workflows-core:<name>` names a shared reference in the `workflows-core` plugin. Load it with `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "<name>")` — never by path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to this plugin, which does not carry it.

`/release-notes` produces a **customer-facing release-notes draft** for a resolved
Product Requirements Document (or any ticket) from the resolved PRD folder.
It optionally grounds the prose in the diffs of the refs the implementation record and the commit scan name, renders the example-docs authored
release-notes body — a plain **Category:** label + `### title` + prose for the `feature-updates` /
`breaking-changes` destinations, or one bare past-tense sentence for `fixes` — with **no
`{{#internal-note}}`, no identifiers, no PR links** (the docs automation adds the metadata
wrapper), runs a light style gate, and writes the draft to a persistent destination for the
user to paste wherever their release notes are published.

Usage: `/release-notes <ADDRESS> [--version <v>] [--no-docs] [--docs <path>]`. `--docs <path>` — points documentation grounding at that root for this run instead of `${DOCS_PATH:-/workspace/docs}`; **strip the flag and its value together** before any remaining-argument classification, or the path is read as part of the address. Declared for every consumer by `workflows-core:docs-grounding` *Procedure* step 1 (*Flags first*), which resolves it; this command only has to recognise it and pass the invocation through. Here `<ADDRESS>` is a key or an
`@<path>` naming a folder in the specs tree.

- **`--version <v>`** (optional) — the release this note belongs to. Absent, the grill asks once;
  declined, the draft omits it. Never invented.

For full feature documentation use `/document`; for Epic drafting use `/epics`.

This command makes **zero external API calls** and **never writes into the docs repo**.

---

## Phase 0 — Load

0. **Flags.** Strip every recognised flag from `$ARGUMENTS` before step 1 reads a positional token —
   `--version <v>` and `--docs <path>`, **each together with the token after it**, and `--no-docs`
   (boolean). Unstripped, a flag is a token like any other: `--docs` is read as the address, or its
   path is. `--docs` and `--no-docs` are carried to the `resolve-docs-grounding` call; `--version` is
   consumed where the version is needed.
1. **Resolve the address.** Parse the **single positional address** from `$ARGUMENTS` — a `<KEY>`, or an `@<path>` naming a
   folder or a file inside one. **On a `<KEY>`, `$SPECS_PATH` comes first:** if it is unset, stop
   naming it before resolving anything or running the specs-repo preflight below
   (`choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]`, `workflows-core:escalation-rules`
   *Required path environment variable unset*) — a key is found only by searching the specs tree, so
   with no tree the `absent` stop below would name the wrong cause and offer a re-enter that cannot
   succeed. An `@<path>` address needs no specs tree to resolve and runs on, exactly as `/document`'s
   *Mode detection* does. Then resolve the address with `resolve-address` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3). Carry the resolved `path`, `kind` and
   `key` forward; `ambiguous` → stop, naming every match; `invalid` → stop with `RELEASE_NOTES_NEEDS_KEY` below, naming the token that failed §1's grammar (a token that fails it is no `<KEY>`, so the `$SPECS_PATH` test above does not stop it, and `resolve-address` tests the grammar before it searches). **`absent` is a stop, not a folder to create** — this command creates no folder in the specs tree. Surface the `key dir not found` rule in `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "escalation-rules")` (`choices: ["Re-enter key", "Cancel"]`) and name what does create one: a `PRD-` folder comes from `/product-workflows:idea <KEY>` or `/product-workflows:create-prd <KEY>` on the idea route and from `/product-workflows:brd-split` on its parent BRD on the BRD route; an `EPIC-` folder comes from `/product-workflows:epics <PRD-ADDRESS>` and from no other command.

   **Place the folder, and carry the PRD folder and the focus.** An `EPIC-` address drafts the note
   for one Epic, and its folder holds no `prd.md`: the PRD it belongs to is the folder above it. So
   place the resolved folder at a level as `workflows-core:addressing` §4.1 does — by its prefix,
   never by the kind it asserts, which on a BRD-route slice is `brd` — taking its container test
   first, and carry forward:
   - `<PRD>` — the **PRD folder's** `key`, read off its carrier (§4): the resolved folder's own where
     §4.1 places it at PRD level, its parent's where §4.1 places it at Epic level. That folder is
     **the PRD folder** — what every later phase means by *the resolved PRD folder* — and Phase 3
     reads it.
   - `focus_key` — the resolved folder's `key` where §4.1 places it at Epic level, `null` where it
     places it at PRD level.

   **An address that resolves but leads to no `prd.md` the run can read stops here, and so does
   one whose PRD folder carries no key — after the specs-repo preflight below and before Phase 1
   asks anything — each with a stop of its own.** The placement above is all the preflight needs:
   it gives the run key set (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §3.2) — the resolved key, and on an
   Epic run `<PRD>` beside `focus_key`. So run the preflight as soon as placement is done, and test
   for these stops only once it has settled the specs checkout's branch: a stale plugin branch it
   switches away from would otherwise make a `prd.md` that is on the default branch look absent. None of these is the `key dir not found` rule: the key resolved, so re-entering it cannot help. A
   PRD-level or Epic-level folder whose PRD folder holds a `prd.md` and carries a key takes none of
   them and runs on as above.
   - **A BRD container** — the folder §4.1's container test places — holds no PRD: a BRD's PRDs are
     authored in its `PRD-` slices. List the slices under it by the positive test §4.1 names, each
     immediate subdirectory carrying a `brd-link.md` whose `parent:` names the container. A slice
     is listed by the `key` its own carrier asserts (§4); one whose carrier asserts none is listed by
     its `@<path>` with `(no key — give it a carrier, workflows-core:addressing §5)` and is not
     enterable. Stop:
     `RELEASE_NOTES_BRD_NOT_SLICED: <KEY> resolves to a BRD container at <path>, which holds no PRD — its PRDs are authored in its PRD- slices: <each slice key, found by workflows-core:addressing §4.1's positive test>.`
     `choices: ["Enter a slice key", "Cancel"]`. **The key the operator types — after "Enter a slice
     key", or in the harness's free-text option — is resolved against the keyed slices this stop
     listed, and never parsed or resolved on its own.** An answer equal to one listed key
     re-enters this step's address resolution with that slice's `@<path>`, which the listing already
     holds, so no key is searched for again and `$SPECS_PATH` is not needed for it. An answer equal
     to none — a keyless slice's path among them — re-presents this stop, saying the answer named
     none of the enterable slices. "Cancel" ends the run. **Where the test finds no slice, there is
     nothing to enter, so no `choices:` array is shown** and the stop is a plain one: its message
     ends at `…authored in its PRD- slices.`, and `It has no slice yet: '/product-workflows:brd-split <KEY> "<how to cut it>"' carves one where this BRD's ledger leaves a row unallocated; where it leaves none, coverage-ledger-format.md §5 names the repairs.` follows it.
   - **A folder §4.1 places at no level** is not guessed at. Stop, a plain stop with no `choices:`,
     because nothing the run can offer fixes the folder:
     `RELEASE_NOTES_FOLDER_NOT_PLACED: <KEY> resolves to <path>, which carries <what it carries> and nothing workflows-core:addressing §4.1 places at any level. <the remedy>`
     `<what it carries>` names its top-level files and what `kind:` and `key:` each asserts — a
     `prd.md` asserting no `kind:` among them, where it holds one. `<the remedy>` is to give the
     folder a carrier (`workflows-core:addressing` §5) and, where it holds an `idea.md` and no
     `prd.md`, to run `/product-workflows:create-prd <KEY>`, whose `prd.md` places it (§4.1). On an
     `@<path>` to a folder with no carrier, §3 returns no key: `<KEY>` in the message is that
     `@<path>`, and the remedy's `<KEY>` is left for the operator to supply (§3 step 1).
   - **A PRD folder with no key.** Where §4.1 places the PRD folder at PRD level but `<PRD>` came
     back empty — an `@<path>` to a folder with no carrier (§3 step 1), such as a slice whose
     `brd-link.md` asserts no `key:`, or an Epic whose PRD folder has none — stop, naming that folder
     and the two ways on §3 step 1 gives: give it a carrier (`workflows-core:addressing` §5), or,
     where its name is unprefixed, address it by its `<KEY>`. This command needs the key:
     Phase 8 titles a new `release-notes.md` `# Release notes — <PRD> <slug>`.
   - **A PRD folder holding no `prd.md`.** Where §4.1 places the resolved folder at PRD or Epic
     level, test the PRD folder for a `prd.md`. The test is the file's presence: a `prd.md` asserting
     no `kind: prd` is read in Phase 3, not refused. Where there is none, stop — a plain stop with no
     `choices:`:
     `RELEASE_NOTES_NO_PRD: <KEY>'s folder <path> holds no prd.md. <the remedy>`
     `<KEY>` is `<PRD>` and `<path>` the PRD folder, on an Epic-level run as on a PRD-level one.
     `<the remedy>` turns on what that folder carries, because `/product-workflows:create-prd`
     refuses a BRD-route slice in three states, as `/product-workflows:epics`' `EPICS_NO_PRD`
     remedy table also records:
     - **No `brd-link.md`** — an idea-route PRD folder: `Run /product-workflows:create-prd <KEY> first.`
     - **A `brd-link.md`** — a BRD-route slice. Read the rows its `claims:` names (its gate set) and
       their dispositions from the slice's own `coverage-ledger.md`, never from a `ledger:` line,
       and take the first row that applies:
       - `coverage-ledger.md` missing while `claims:` names rows: name no command. Report the
         missing `<path>/coverage-ledger.md`, and say `/product-workflows:brd-split` wrote it with
         the slice.
       - A gate-set row still `unallocated`:
         `Allocate it with /product-workflows:brd-split <KEY>, then run /product-workflows:create-prd <KEY>.`
         Say beside it that `/brd-split`'s own Phase 0 stops, naming `/product-workflows:prd-ground <KEY>`,
         where this slice's grounding findings do not each carry a verifier verdict.
       - No gate-set row `covered-here`, and the gate set **empty**: a standing empty child. Name
         `/product-workflows:brd-split <PARENT-KEY>`, which keeps or removes it, `<PARENT-KEY>` read
         off the same `brd-link.md`'s `parent:` — with `"<how to cut it>"` where the parent's ledger
         still holds an `unallocated` row, bare where it holds none, and neither form, reporting the
         parent's ledger by path, where it cannot be read.
       - No gate-set row `covered-here`, and the gate set **non-empty**: name no command.
         `This slice holds no PRD of its own — <what each claimed row resolved to> — so there is nothing here to draft a release note from.`
       - Otherwise: `Run /product-workflows:create-prd <KEY> first.`

     **Where the PRD folder is above an Epic and §4.1 does not place it at PRD level** — an Epic
     folder at the top of `specifications/`, or under a BRD container or any other folder that is
     not PRD-level — no PRD folder stands above the Epic, and the stop reads instead:
     `RELEASE_NOTES_NO_PRD: <focus_key> resolves to an Epic folder at <path> with no PRD folder above it. Move the Epic folder into its PRD folder (git mv) and re-run.`
     — `<path>` here being the Epic folder's own.

   With no positional address, or one `resolve-address` returns `invalid`, stop with
   `RELEASE_NOTES_NEEDS_KEY: /release-notes needs a PRD or Epic address — a key, or an @<path> to its folder.` —
   this command has no direct-prompt behavior.

**Specs-repo preflight** — run as soon as step 1 has resolved and placed the address, and before
step 1's named stops (above). Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git specs-preflight")` and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline: flush any leftover session
artifacts from an earlier run, retry an artifact commit that failed to push,
and settle the branch. This runs against `$SPECS_PATH` only — `git -C
"$SPECS_PATH"`, never a `cd`, so the code/docs repo this run is working
in is untouched (§1 rule 1). Prompt-free and silent when the specs repo
is clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5 notice;
if it returns `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag for the whole
run — the terminal `commit-artifacts` step skips on it.

---

## Phase 1 — Clarification

**Rule: Ask, don't guess.** Group questions; use `choices` arrays; 2–4 options, and never author an "Other" option — the harness supplies the free-text escape itself (`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0).

- **Diff grounding** (default OFF — the PRD is usually enough for release notes):
  ```
  choices: ["PRD content only (Recommended)", "Also ground in the recorded refs' diffs (you'll pick repos)", "Cancel"]
  ```
  If the user also grounds in diffs, additionally ask the `$REPOS_PATH` sub-question below.

- **Repos search base (`$REPOS_PATH`)** (only if diff grounding is ON). Read `${REPOS_PATH:-/workspace}`; may be a colon-separated list. Ask:
  ```
  choices: ["Use $REPOS_PATH (default /workspace) (Recommended)", "Use a different path (you'll be prompted)", "Cancel"]
  ```
  Clones are located in Phase 4 by matching `git remote` against each repo slug the Phase 3 implementation record and its commit scan named — not by assuming a `<base>/<slug>` directory name. Nothing here asks which pull-request statuses to include: Phase 3 builds its refs from `implementation.md` and a `git log --grep` scan, neither of which carries one, and `refs[]` is the only element list `diff-summarizer` takes.

- **Output destination — derived, not asked.** The draft lands in **`release-notes.md` in the
  resolved PRD folder**, appended as a section. There is one home now, so the destination question
  and its old fallback ladder are gone.

  **The three former destinations are three sections of that one file**, selected by Change Type
  exactly as they selected a file before: `## Breaking changes`, `## Feature updates`, `## Fixes`.
  The taxonomy is unchanged and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/release-note-types.md` remains its
  authority — only where a draft lands changed.

  **The release version is the heading those three sit under, one level above them** —
  `release-note-types.md` §1 fixes the three levels, and Phase 8 appends by them:

  ```markdown
  # Release notes — ACME-77 billing

  # 1.24.0

  ## Feature updates

  **Category:** Capability

  ### <feature title>

  <prose>

  ## Fixes

  Fixed an issue where …
  ```

  Exactly one Summary per run, appended under the resolved version and type. A run whose version the
  operator declined appends under `# Unreleased`.

  **NEVER write into a docs repo, a code repo, or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository.** The PRD
  folder is in `$SPECS_PATH`, which is where the terminal `commit-artifacts` step commits it with the
  rest of the run's artifacts.


- **Style check** (default ON):
  ```
  choices: ["Run prose-style-checker then apply safe fixes (Recommended)", "Run prose-style-checker, report only (no auto-fix)", "Skip style check"]
  ```

Also display: the resolved PRD folder, its `key`, `$REPOS_PATH` (or "N/A — PRD-only"), and the version this draft will be filed under.

---

## Phase 1.5 — Classify

Invoke the `model-routing` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "workflows-core:model-routing"`), then classify the task. Release-notes drafting is **MODERATE** (bounded prose synthesis from a single ticket; no Opus planning or review gate). State the classification and a one-sentence reason, and record the `model_routing` block §4 defines — Phase 6 pastes it, and its `detection_model` (the §2.1 Sonnet chain) is what Phase 5's `diff-summarizer` batch and Phase 6's writer are pinned to.

---

## Phase 2 — Plan + approval

1. **Plan.** Before presenting the plan, run `resolve-docs-grounding release-notes` per `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "docs-grounding resolve-docs-grounding")` — this is the run's only consent-bearing step (an index build or a capped refresh), so it must resolve here, before Phase 3's folder read and Phase 4/5's diff resolution do any of the run's real work. Present: resolved `key`, destination, diff-grounding on/off (+ `$REPOS_PATH` and repos to scan when on), style-check choice, and the `docs grounding:` line that `resolve-docs-grounding` returned, verbatim — including its `retrieval:` value and any index-build, staleness, or shadowing clause (off switch: --no-docs). Ask:
   ```
   choices: ["Approve & continue (Recommended)", "Revise plan", "Cancel"]
   ```

---

## Phase 3 — Read the PRD folder

**Read the PRD folder directly** (Phase 0 step 1) — its `prd.md` for the product content, and, where `focus_key` is set, the Epic folder the address named and what it holds; that alone when diff grounding is OFF. When ON, read the `implementation.md` records too, which is where the refs the diff grounding needs are recorded (`workflows-core:implementation-format` §1) — `/dev-workflows:implement` writes one into the folder of the unit it implemented, an Epic's or the PRD's (that §1, which also says whose a block an earlier run left in the PRD folder is), so read the focus Epic's own where `focus_key` is set, and otherwise the PRD folder's and every `EPIC-` folder's under it, wherever one stands.

**Resolve the diff sources — two of them, merged.** **Only when diff grounding is ON** (Phase 1): it is opt-in and advisory here, so a run that declined it skips this step entirely and grounds its prose in the PRD alone. When it is on, invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "implementation-format")` and follow its §4. **Both steps below run inside a clone, so build the slug→clone map here, once** — the map Phase 4 resolves against, by the recipe stated there: for each top-level directory under each entry of `$REPOS_PATH`, `timeout 5 git -C <dir> remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null`, a trailing `.git` stripped, the URL's last path segment taken as that clone's slug. Step 2's `git log` runs in the clone, and so does the `git rev-parse` that resolves a block's abbreviated `commit:` to the full SHA a read-set comparison takes (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/release-note-types.md` §1). Phase 4 resolves each in-scope slug against this same map rather than rebuilding it, and is where the operator settles a slug it matches to no clone; until then such a slug is scanned in no repository and compared in none, and nothing under it has been read:

1. **The record.** Read the `implementation.md` records named above. **Read only the blocks no earlier note covers** — a second release must not re-describe the first one's work, and the notes already in `release-notes.md` are the only honest boundary. `workflows-core:implementation-format` §4 fixes it per record, by what each earlier note read and never by a date: a block is skipped only where every commit it records is in the read set of an earlier note covering its record, a note for the PRD covering every record and a note for an Epic that Epic's alone, each note's scope and read set read off the comment above it (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/release-note-types.md` §1, which also says what a note with none counts as). So a note drafted for one Epic moves no other Epic's boundary. An earlier note that records no read set bounds by its date instead, §4's one fallback: list every block that date rule dropped, and every commit it dropped by the commit's own date, beside the ones used — a commit dropped with a block recording it is accounted for by that block's listing and is not written out again (that same §4). A ref two of these records name — the same repository and the same commit — is one ref, counted once (that same §4). **Name the blocks this run used**, so a wrong boundary is visible rather than silent.
2. **The scan.** For each repository — those `implementation.md` names, or, when it names none, the
   repositories resolved from `$REPOS_PATH` — search commit messages for the identifiers this run
   already holds, with the `git log` command `workflows-core:implementation-format` §4 gives: one
   `--grep` per token, each matching only as a whole key. The tokens — keys and `workitem_key`s —
   are the ones §4 names for this run's scope — the focus Epic's where `focus_key` is set, and,
   where it is null, **the PRD folder's and every `EPIC-` folder's**, since a whole-key match on the
   PRD's key does not reach the Epic keys `/product-workflows:epics` mints by extending it, and
   never reached an Epic's `workitem_key` — each read off a folder this run resolved or listed;
   **nothing is parsed out of a commit message.** This is what finds work the plugin did not do — a commit written by hand
   after a session ended, a colleague's push, a follow-up nobody ran a command for.

   **The note boundary binds this source too** (§4): drop every commit whose SHA a block in the
   records read names, covered or not, and every commit in the read set of an earlier note covering
   a record whose token it matched — and nothing else, save what §4's date fallback drops and this
   run lists. Otherwise a covered block's commits, and every hand-made commit an earlier note
   described, come back as unrecorded work.

**Merge and dedupe by SHA.** Anything the scan finds beyond the recorded blocks is reported as
**unrecorded work**, named as such with its commits listed: folding hand-made commits silently into
the recorded set would make the record look more complete than it is.

**Carry the merged set forward as this run's *provisional* read set** — every commit taken from a
block and every commit the scan kept, by repository. **It is provisional because nothing here has
opened a diff**: the repositories are resolved to clones in Phase 4 and their diffs read in Phase 5,
and what Phase 8 writes into the scope comment is the set Phase 5 **settles**, which is what bounds
a later run. A commit enters that settled set only where its diff was **read** — its repository
resolved to a clone, the element carrying it resolved there, and the commit itself resolved in that
clone — so nothing Phase 5's drop list removes reaches it, whatever a block or the scan said of
them; that list is the authority on which routes leave a commit unopened, and is not restated here. Writing a
commit this run did not open would lose that work for good: a later run drops every commit an
earlier note recorded as read, so no note would ever describe it
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/release-note-types.md` §1 — *"A commit the run could not resolve
was not read and is not written, so a later run reads it again"*). Phase 5 adds to it each SHA a
`diff-summarizer` summary names its key-commit fallback as having drawn on; those three are the
whole of what can enter it (that same §1, which fixes the 12-character form every entry is written
in).

**Report the scan's own reach.** Say **how many commits it scanned and how many matched**. Only a
commit whose message names the key is findable, and no convention compels a human to follow one — so
a zero-match scan in a repository that has commits is a signal about the commit convention
(`docs/reference/commit-convention.md`), not proof that no work happened.

**On a repository the scan left at zero matches, run §4's report-only unanchored probe** — zero
**before** the note boundary drops anything, since a repository where the whole-key `--grep` matched
and an earlier note had already read every match is one whose work is fully reported rather than
one the scan could not reach, and reading the count after the drop would fire the probe there — and
print what it matched, in the words that section gives — *"may name this key inside a branch name —
inspect by hand"*. Printing is the whole of it: none of those commits is handed to
`diff-summarizer`, none joins this run's read set (the carry above names its three sources, and this
is not one), and none joins a drop set, so the note this run appends covers not one of them. **The
whole-key scan will not match them on a later run either** — carrying the key only inside a branch
name is exactly what it cannot see — so what re-reports them is this same probe, and only while
that repository is still at zero whole-key matches: one commit there whose **message** carries one
of this run's tokens — a body line or a `Work-Item:` trailer as readily as a subject, since the scan
matches anywhere in a message (§4) — silences the probe and leaves them unreported.

Hand each resolved ref to `diff-summarizer` as a `refs[]` element — `{branch_from, branch_to, title}`,
the shape its Inputs declare for `refs[]`, `title` optional — taken on the pure-local-git path.
`repo_path` is a top-level input of that agent, passed once at the Phase 5 dispatch and never
repeated inside an element. No URL, no host classification, no `gh` requirement.


When `focus_key` is set (Phase 0 step 1 — the address named an Epic folder), scope the **Phase 6
render input** to that `EPIC-` folder and what it holds — its `epic.md`, `specification.md`,
`design.md` and `implementation.md`; there is no Story / Sub-task level beneath it — so the release
note covers that Epic's user-facing changes rather than the whole PRD. This scopes only what Phase 6
renders; it does not mutate the stored handoff that other phases read. When `focus_key` is null, the
draft covers the whole PRD, as it does on a run with no Epic address.

The PRD folder holds a `prd.md` here: Phase 0 step 1's `RELEASE_NOTES_NO_PRD` has already
stopped a run whose PRD folder holds none.

Capture `change_type` and `release_notes_category` from the PRD folder's `prd.md`, where it
carries them (null when absent). **Read them from the PRD, which is the reversal**: these were
dropdowns set outside the plugin and returned by an import, so this step used to read the import and
was told explicitly *not* to read the authored PRD. Nothing returns them now, and the PRD is the only
place either can be authored (`workflows-core:prd-format`).

**`release_versions` — `--version <v>`, else ask.** The flag takes the release this note belongs to.
Absent, the grill asks once; declined, the draft omits it. **Never invent one.** It is not parsed
from anything, and the PRD's `release_versions`, where `/create-prd` wrote one, is not read.

## Phase 4 — Resolve repos (only if diff grounding is ON)

Take the slug→clone map Phase 3 built with the diff sources — this phase and that step run under the same one condition, diff grounding ON, so the map is always in hand here and is never built twice. Resolve each in-scope `repo` slug — the ones the Phase 3 implementation record and its commit scan named — against the map: one match → use it; multiple → auto-prefer basename ending `-repo`, then `_repo`/`_fast`, then alphabetically last; zero matches → escalate:
```
choices: ["Skip and continue without its refs", "I'll clone it — wait", "Cancel", "Specify a different absolute path for this repo"]
```

## Phase 5 — Diff summarisation (only if diff grounding is ON)

Spawn `diff-summarizer` in batches of up to 4 concurrent agents per Agent message, each pinned with ``model: `<detection_model — §9 / §2.1 Sonnet chain>` ``, passing each resolved absolute `repo_path`, its `repo_url_slug`, and `refs[]` — the `{branch_from, branch_to, title}` elements Phase 3 built for that repo, which is the only element list that agent takes. Collect the outputs into a `diff_summaries` array.

**Per-repo summarizer status.** Handle each returned status before continuing:

- `OK` / `PARTIAL` / `NO_PRS_RESOLVED` — use the result; record unresolved refs in the run report.
- `REPO_MISSING` — escalate per the `Repo missing (after resolution)` rule in `workflows-core:escalation-rules`.
- `DIRTY_TREE` — escalate per the `Dirty working tree` rule in the same file.
- `REFRESH_BLOCKED` — escalate per the `Refresh blocked` rule in the same file.
- `prep.read_only: true` — not a failure. Resolution ran at `prep.scanned_ref`. Escalate per the `Read-only mount — ref stale or diverged` rule **only** when `prep.ref_committed_at` is more than 14 days old or `prep.head_divergence.ahead > 0`; otherwise proceed silently.

**Settle the run's read set** — Phase 3 carried it provisionally, and this step fixes what Phase 8 writes into the scope comment. **Add** each key-commit fallback's SHAs: where an element came back `resolved_via: key_commits`, its `summary` names every sha it drew on — add those, under that repository. They were read, so a later note must cover them; an element resolved `local_ref` keeps the ref Phase 3 carried for it and adds nothing new here, while a `key_commits` element adds those SHAs and keeps **none** of the ref it was handed — the drop below states that rather than leaving it to be inferred from this sentence. **Drop every provisional commit whose diff nothing opened**, by repository: every commit under a repository that reached no `diff-summarizer` — one Phase 3's map matched to no clone and Phase 4's escalation did not resolve either, the operator having answered *Skip and continue without its refs*; every commit carried by an element returned under `unresolved_prs`, `NO_PRS_RESOLVED` being the case where that is every element of a repository and `PARTIAL` the case where it is some of them; **every commit carried by an element that came back `resolved_via: key_commits`** — that fallback is reached only where the element's own ref is neither a branch in the clone nor a commit in it (`diff-summarizer`, *Key-commit fallback*), which is exactly the state a squash-merged and deleted branch leaves, so nothing opened the commit Phase 3 carried for it however much the fallback then read in its place; and every commit under a repository whose `REPO_MISSING`, `DIRTY_TREE` or `REFRESH_BLOCKED` escalation ended without a summary. **Record what was dropped, by repository and by SHA**, and report it in Phase 8 beside `Blocks used`: those commits were not read, so this run's note does not cover them and the next grounded run reads them again — which is the whole point of dropping them rather than writing them out as read. **Say what that costs on the `key_commits` route, since it is the one that recurs**: the block is re-taken next release and the fallback runs again over the same work, so the note re-describes it. That is work re-described rather than work lost, which is the direction this boundary is built to fail in, and the `Not read:` line is what makes the repetition explicable rather than surprising.

Diff grounding is opt-in and advisory here: a repo the user skips degrades the grounding, never the run.

---

## Phase 5.5 — Documentation grounding dispatch (optional)

`docs_grounding` was already resolved in Phase 2 — consume that cached result here; never re-run `resolve-docs-grounding`. When `docs_grounding: ON`, `dispatch-docs-grounder` with `feature_summary` = the ticket goal + release themes, `key` = `key`. Carry the digest into Phase 6 with **writer-attach** consumption. When OFF, skip silently. (Independent of diff grounding.)

---

## Phase 6 — Render the draft

**Resolve `run_phase`.** `/release-notes` runs at two points in a PRD's life, and the
`release-note-types.md` §4 documentation-link rule depends on which. Reuse the existing signal from
`workflows-core:cost-emission` §7 — resolve the PRD's specs dir
by calling `resolve-address <PRD>` (`Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "addressing resolve-address")`, §3), then glob it for `specification.md` and `design.md`. That entry point searches every level §3 bounds and carries §5's legacy fallback; `workflows-core:addressing` §7 records why this command is one of its adopters.
A flat glob alone would also be **narrower than the signal this step says it reuses**: cost-emission
§7 defers to the specs-dir matching `workflows-core:feedback-emission` and
`workflows-core:followup-emission` perform, whose pattern already spans both levels.

- **neither present** → `run_phase: pm`. The feature is not built and its documentation does not
  exist yet, so the note carries no documentation link and the command never asks for one.
- **either present** → `run_phase: dev`. The author may supply a redirect short link that will later
  point at the page `/document` publishes.
- **`$SPECS_PATH` unset or the dir missing** → `run_phase: pm` (the safe default — it only suppresses
  a link, never fabricates one).

This is the same inference `emit-cost` already applies in Phase 11; do not add a question for it.

→ Agent (subagent_type: "docs-workflows:release-notes-writer", model: `<detection_model — §9.2 delegated writer / §2.1 Sonnet chain; this run is MODERATE (Phase 1.5)>`):
  > "Render the release-notes draft for this brief:
  >
  > folder_read: [the Phase 3 handoff — scoped to that `EPIC-` folder and what it holds when focus_key is set]
  > diff_summaries:      [the Phase 5 array, or omit when diff grounding was off]
  > docs_grounding:      [the Phase 5.5 digest, or omit when OFF/EMPTY]
  > change_type:            [from Phase 3, else null]
  > release_notes_category: [from Phase 3, else null]
  > run_phase:           [pm | dev — resolved immediately above, in this phase]
  > model_routing:       [the block from Phase 1.5]
  > code_repos:          [the Phase-4 resolved {slug, path} map when diff grounding is on; omit otherwise]"

If `status: PARTIAL`, surface each `gaps` entry with `recommended_action: "ask user"` and let the user supply the label/prose or accept a `<!-- TODO -->` marker.

For a `field: change_type` gap, the destination was inferred with low confidence — and the
destination decides the draft's whole shape. Confirm it by **consequence**, never by enum label.
This fires ONLY when the Change Type was inferred — `change_type` null, or one of the two values
`release-note-types.md` §7 marks not routable, `not applicable` among them; when the PRD carries a
routable one, no prompt appears.

State the inference, then ask:

> This note reads like a `<proposed type>`, so the draft is shaped as `<shape>` and lands in
> `<destination>` — confirm that route below, or pick another.

```
choices: ["Feature update — titled section with a docs link, under ## Feature updates", "Breaking change — titled section with remediation steps, under ## Breaking changes", "Fix — one self-contained sentence, under ## Fixes"]
```

The array is presented as written — it carries the three routes once each, and the proposal is the
one the question above it names, never a further option repeating it, so no run renders a duplicate
(`workflows-core:escalation-rules`: there is no permitted adjustment; a recommendation the array does
not carry belongs in the prose beside it, which is where this one is). Apply the choice to
`release_notes_block.change_type` (Feature update → `New technology support`, Breaking change →
`Breaking change`, Fix → `Bug fix`) + `destination` and **re-render** the draft in the chosen shape —
switching between `fixes` and a titled destination changes the body structure, not just a label. The
chosen value never becomes text in the draft.

For a `field: deprecation_eol` gap (a deprecation was detected but the required
end-of-life date is unclear), ask the user:
```
choices: ["Enter the end-of-life date (you'll be prompted; end-of-support optional)", "Leave the <!-- TODO: end-of-life date --> marker in the draft", "This isn't a deprecation — drop the note"]
```
On a supplied date, replace the `<!-- TODO: end-of-life date -->` placeholder with the
end-of-life date (and end-of-support date when given), formatted per the prose-style
(e.g. `November 30, 2026`).

When `release-notes-writer` returns `gaps[]` entries that have `prd_phrasing` and `source_phrasing` (source-truth discrepancies), present the discrepancy table and per-claim prompt as in `/document` (keyed mode) Phase 5.8:

1. Show the analysis table (claim, PRD phrasing, source phrasing, location).
2. Ask:
   ```
   choices: ["Decide per discrepancy (Recommended)", "Document ALL as actual (code)", "Document ALL as intended (PRD)", "Skip ALL and report (drafts a bug report)"]
   ```
3. Apply the decision to the draft prose: `document-as-code` → use source phrasing; `document-as-spec` → use PRD phrasing (no marker in release notes prose — the gap is recorded only in the gaps file); `skip-and-report` → omit the claim.
4. For `document-as-spec` or `skip-and-report`: resolve `bug_report_destination` to the resolved PRD folder. Write/append `<bug_report_destination>/<KEY>-implementation-gaps.md` using the §7.5 format from `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "source-truth")`, setting `Spec phrasing:` to `(no spec)` (this flow has no spec).

Pass `code_repos` (the Phase-4 resolved map) to the writer when diff-grounding is on.

---

## Phase 7 — Style gate (optional)

If the user chose a style check in Phase 1:

→ Agent (subagent_type: "prose-style:prose-style-checker", model: `<Sonnet detection chain — claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6 / 4-5>`) on the `combined_rendered` draft, written first to a scratch file of its own — `command mktemp -t rn-draft-XXXXXX` names one, outside every repository — since the checker and the fixer both take files, and hand the checker `repo_root`: the specs repository, `git -C <the resolved PRD folder> rev-parse --show-toplevel`, wherever that finds one. **Never to `release-notes.md`**: Phase 8 appends the draft there exactly once, and a checker or fixer handed that file would also check, and could edit, the sections earlier runs appended. **The rules that apply are the specs repository's, as for `release-notes.md` itself.** The checker takes its house-style overlay from `<repo-root>/.prose-style/rules/`, and where no `repo_root` names that repository it derives it from the files it is handed: for a scratch file outside every repository, that is the working directory's repository, or none — a code clone's rules, say, where the session stands in one. `repo_root` makes it the repository `release-notes.md` lives in, so the draft is checked under the rules that file would be checked under, the checker's later orders included. That is why the scratch copy stays rather than a check in place: it keeps the checker and the fixer off every earlier run's section and writes nothing into a repository mid-run, and `repo_root` costs neither.

**Then, where Phase 7 handed the checker `repo_root`, read it back from the checker's output**, where `prose-style` 0.4.0, which added the input, echoes the `<repo-root>` it took. Where the echo is the path handed to it, the draft was checked under the specs repository's rules. Where the output carries no `repo_root` — a `prose-style` older than 0.4.0, which ignores the input and derives `<repo-root>` as though none were named, from the scratch copy and then the working directory — or carries another path, record the style check **`DEGRADED`** in the Phase 8 report: its reason says the specs repository's house-style rules may not have applied, names the rule set the checker did apply (its `rules_source`), and says to update `prose-style` to 0.4.0 or later. So an older checker never applies another repository's rules silently. This plugin declares `prose-style` by name alone, with no version range, so an older one can be installed beside it: the echo is the test that holds wherever this command runs.

If violations are returned and the user chose auto-fix:

→ Agent (subagent_type: "prose-style:prose-fixer", model: `<Sonnet detection chain — claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6 / 4-5>`) to apply safe fixes to that scratch file.

Then read the scratch file back as `combined_rendered`.

**Remove the scratch file in every case** — after a fixer ran, after a report-only check, and where the checker returned no violations at all — with `command rm -f -- "<scratch file>"`: the Bash tool's shell carries the user's aliases and shell functions, and an `rm` of theirs — an `rm -i` alias answered no from an empty standard input, or a function — could otherwise leave the file behind.

`prose-style` is a declared dependency of this plugin, so the only thing that skips this phase is the user's own "Skip style check" answer in Phase 1 — never a missing plugin. Record that answer in the report line below.

---

## Phase 8 — Write + report

1. **Append** the `combined_rendered` draft to `release-notes.md` in the resolved PRD folder — the one destination Phase 1 derives, laid out as Phase 1 lays it out. Where the file does not exist, create it with its `# Release notes — <PRD> <slug>` title, `<slug>` the PRD folder's. Where it has no `#` heading for the version this draft is filed under (Phase 1: the resolved version, or `# Unreleased`), add that heading at the end of the file; where that version has no `##` section for the draft's Change Type, add the section at the end of that version's part of the file, which runs to the next `#` heading; then add at the end of that section, which runs to the next `##` or `#` heading, the draft's scope comment in the form `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/release-note-types.md` §1 gives — its first line `<!-- release-note scope: <KEY> <YYYY-MM-DD>`, `<KEY>` being `focus_key` where it is set and `<PRD>` where it is null, and the date today's; then one `read: <repo> <sha> …` line per repository naming every commit this run read there, 12 characters each, or `read: none` where it read no commit; then `-->` — and the draft on the line after it. The comment records whose work the draft described and what the run read, and is not part of the draft. Those are the levels `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/release-note-types.md` §1 fixes, and they are why the append lands where it should: a draft's own `### <feature title>` sits below its section, so it never ends one. **The append is the whole write**: nothing already in the file is rewritten, reordered or removed, since every earlier section is an earlier run's note, so there is no question to ask and no option that replaces the file. NEVER write into a docs repo.

2. **Report:**
   ```
   ## Release-notes draft — <KEY>
   - Appended to: <the resolved PRD folder>/release-notes.md, under <version | Unreleased> → <## Breaking changes | ## Feature updates | ## Fixes>
   - Shaped as: <Feature update | Breaking change | Fix>  (source: <PRD | inferred>)
   - Category label: <the value | none — omitted from the draft>
   - Deprecation: <EOL <date> (end-of-support <date | —>) | none>
   - Diff grounding: <on (repos: …) | off>
   - Blocks used: <each block by its record and heading date | none>; dropped by §4's date fallback: <each block by its record and heading date, and each commit the date rule dropped by its own date, by SHA, date and subject — a commit dropped with a block recording it is accounted for by that block's listing | none> — on a run with diff grounding on
   - Not read: <per repository whose commits Phase 5 dropped from the read set, the repository and why — skipped at Phase 4, no clone resolved, `unresolved_prs`, a `resolved_via: key_commits` fallback that opened nothing this run had carried, or an escalation that ended without a summary — and each commit by SHA | none — every provisional commit was read> — on a run with diff grounding on; nothing listed here is written into the scope comment, so the next grounded run reads it again, and on the `key_commits` cause that means this block returns next release
   - Branch-name probe: <per repository the whole-key scan left at zero matches: each commit it matched, by SHA, date and subject — may name a key inside a branch name, inspect by hand | fired on <repo>, matched nothing | not fired — the scan matched in every repository> — on a run with diff grounding on; nothing listed here was read
   - Style check: <applied N safe fixes | report only (M findings) | skipped — you chose "Skip style check"> — rules: <the checker's rules_source, where it ran><; DEGRADED — Phase 7's reason, where Phase 7 recorded it>
   - Reminder: paste the draft just appended to <the resolved PRD folder>/release-notes.md, under <version | Unreleased> → <## Breaking changes | ## Feature updates | ## Fixes>, wherever your release notes are published — the docs automation adds the {{#internal-note}} metadata and emits it into example-docs.

   ### Next step
   [leaf/closure per `workflows-core:next-phase-offer` — guidance only, never auto-invoked: the release note is drafted. If earlier pipeline phases remain, continue — hand to PA → `/product-workflows:create-ard <PRD>` or PE → `/product-workflows:epics <PRD>`; if the change is already built and documented, the PRD is fully processed.]

   ### Context hygiene

   The resume pointer is written in the terminal cost phase (Phase 11), per `workflows-core:session-hygiene` §1. Then:

   - **Release note drafted and the PRD fully processed?** → nothing to suggest — you're done.
   - **A PA/PE phase still pending for this PRD (e.g. `/product-workflows:create-ard`, `/product-workflows:epics`), even yourself?** → run **`/clear`** before switching roles.
   - Consider **`/rename <PRD-ID>-<slug>-<role>`** to relocate this session later — `<role>` is this run's inferred lane (`pm` on the early run, `dev` once a spec or design exists).

   Guidance only — see `workflows-core:session-hygiene`.
   ```

---

## Phase 9 — Session maintenance & feedback

Terminal phase — runs AFTER the Phase 8 report is composed; NEVER interrupts
an earlier phase. `/release-notes` has no built-in maintenance agent, so this
phase invokes `impl-maintenance` on the Sonnet detection chain and then
persists the plugin-facing slice of its report as session feedback.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (subagent_type: "workflows-core:impl-maintenance", model: `<Sonnet detection chain — claude-sonnet-5, fallback claude-sonnet-4-6 / 4-5>`):
   > "Analyse this session and return a Lessons Learned report.
   >
   > Session handoff:
   > - Command run: /release-notes
   > - What was done: [one-paragraph summary of the release-notes draft produced]
   > - Key events: [source-truth discrepancies, PARTIAL renders, style-check failures, ambiguous destinations — or 'none']
   > - Workarounds used: [manual steps not automated by the workflow — or 'none']
   > - Review verdict: N/A (light gate only, no Opus review)
   > - Test result: N/A (no tests in /release-notes)
   > - Project root: [the resolved PRD folder]"
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Project the report's plugin-facing
   slice into the specs repo by invoking `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "feedback-emission emit-auto")` and calling its `emit-auto` entry point (§6). Pass the Lessons Learned report,
   `command: /release-notes`, the run's `key` and `source`, and
   `plugin_version` (read from
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). `emit-auto` renders only
   the report's **Command workflow improvements**, **New agents / skills**, and
   plugin **Reference docs** sections plus the **Key observations** that
   triggered them (§4) — never target-project `CLAUDE.md`/hook advice — as
   `origin: auto` entries, dedupes by stable `id` (§3), resolves the target via
   the §2 specs-first ladder, and writes silently.
3. **Surface** the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing
   persisted") as this phase's only output.

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits (still true — this
phase only writes the feedback file; those writes are committed by the terminal
`commit-artifacts` step in Phase 11, per
`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §4), NEVER makes an
external API call, and NEVER writes into a docs repo or the current working
directory, where it is not the specs repository.

---

## Phase 10 — Emit follow-up tasks

Terminal phase — runs AFTER the Phase 8 report and the Phase 9 feedback phase;
NEVER interrupts an earlier phase. Persist the run's manual-step follow-ups by
invoking `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "followup-emission")` and executing its steps inline.

1. **Collect** the qualifying follow-ups: the mandatory manual publish step
   ("paste this release-notes draft wherever your release notes are published")
   and any implementation-gap signals surfaced during the run.
2. **Filter** them with the reference's §6 qualifying predicate.
3. **Resolve** the write target via the §4 ladder using `key` and `source`;
   render + place tasks and verbose notes per §1–§3; dedupe per §5. The task
   references the draft file written in Phase 8 rather than duplicating it.
4. **Preview + confirm** per §7 (`approve-all | select | cancel`), then write.

ADDITIVE — the follow-ups also remain in the Phase 8 report. This phase NEVER
fails the run, NEVER commits (still true — this phase only writes follow-up
files; those writes are committed by the terminal `commit-artifacts` step in
Phase 11, per `workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §4), NEVER
makes an external API call, and NEVER writes into a docs repo or the current
working directory, where it is not the specs repository.

---

## Phase 11 — Session cost

Terminal phase — the NEW final operational phase; runs after Phase 10
(follow-ups) and NEVER interrupts an earlier phase. Records this command's
token-cost contribution to the PRD by invoking `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "cost-emission emit-cost")` and calling its single `emit-cost` entry point. Unlike feedback, **cost ALWAYS runs**.

`/release-notes` runs at two different phases by two roles (a PM's early bare-PRD
run and a dev's documenting re-run), so DO NOT pass a fixed phase/role: call
`emit-cost` with `command: /release-notes`, `phase: inferred`, `role: inferred`,
the run's `key` (or `null`) and `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). `emit-cost` applies the §7
inference: **no `specification.md` or `design.md` under the PRD's specs dir ->
`phase: prd-creation`, `role: pm`; either present -> `phase: documenting`, `role:
dev`.** Epic presence is deliberately NOT part of the signal. It then resolves
the transcript + subagents (§1), **advances the chained checkpoint** (§3), prices the run against the price table (§4), records the optional
statusline cross-check (§5), and appends one entry to
`<PRD-dir>/dev-workflows/cost/<sid8>.md` via the specs-first ladder (§8) — pending
+ reconciliation (§9) when no PRD key resolves. **The checkpoint advances even in
the pending / report-only tiers.** Surface the persisted path (or the
report-only notice) as this phase's only output.

**Then write the resume pointer.** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "session-hygiene")` and, per its §1, write/overwrite
`<PRD-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` now — after the cost entry above, so the
pointer reflects the completed run, and before the commit step below, so it
is included in it. Redact per §1. Silent; the printed `### Context hygiene`
guidance already appeared in the Phase 8 report.

**Then commit session artifacts (terminal).** Invoke `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "specs-repo-git commit-artifacts")` and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — the LAST action of the run. It
stages ONLY the §2.1 bounded artifact paths inside `$SPECS_PATH`, commits
`<KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (/release-notes)`, and pushes per
§4 step 5. **The draft is one of those paths**: `release-notes.md` in the
resolved PRD folder is §2.1's `/release-notes` draft, so this step commits
and pushes it with the rest of the run's artifacts, and edits nothing in it.
It NEVER writes into a docs repo, NEVER touches a code repo, or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository; NEVER force-pushes; NEVER fails the run;
and skips entirely when the run carries `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0),
re-emitting that notice. Because the Phase 8 report was composed before this
phase, **print its §6 outcome line here**, as the run's last output — prefixed
`Specs repo:`, with any guard notice repeated in full.

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run and makes no deliverable handoff
commit: it opens no branch and no pull request for the draft, which the
terminal step above commits in the specs repository as one of `$SPECS_PATH`'s
bounded paths (§2.1), and never in a docs or code repository. It
NEVER makes an external API call, and NEVER writes into a docs repo or the
current working directory, where it is not the specs repository; no user name is ever written (§10).

---

## Invariants (always enforced)

- ALWAYS `emit-block` (per `workflows-core:feedback-emission`) before escalating a halt caused by a **plugin / skill / command / reference gap** (a capability the run needed but the plugin lacked) — so a run abandoned at the block still records it. NEVER for a work-quality review BLOCK or an environment / user halt (repo-missing, dirty-tree, key-not-found, cancellation).
- ZERO external API calls — this run has no forge URL to resolve in the first place: Phase 3 builds `refs[]` from `implementation.md` and the commit scan, and `diff-summarizer` takes a ref's diff with pure local `git`.
- Every read of the specs tree is read-only.
- The draft contains NO identifiers, NO PR links, and NO `{{#internal-note}}` block. The scope comment Phase 8 writes above it names a key and the commits the run read, and is not part of the draft (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/release-note-types.md` §1).
- The draft is EXACTLY one Summary, shaped by its destination per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/release-note-types.md` §1/§3 — a plain **Category:** label + `### title` + prose for `breaking-changes` / `feature-updates`, or ONE bare past-tense sentence for `fixes`. It carries NO `Change type:` line and NO `Release-notes category:` line, and its **prose** names no release version — the version is the `#` heading the draft is filed under (Phase 1, `release-note-types.md` §1), which is the only thing that says which release a section belongs to now that the three destinations are three sections of one file. The prohibition survives for the body prose alone. When the change deprecates something the Summary carries a deprecation note (end-of-life date required, end-of-support optional).
- The category label IS the PRD's `release_notes_category`, used verbatim; when the PRD carries none the line is OMITTED. Change Type is sourced `change_type` → infer, and is confirmed with the user ONLY when it was inferred with low confidence — by shape and destination, never by enum label. Neither field is ever asked for by enum label.
- The run has **no worthiness gate**: every PRD is relevant for release notes, so there is no content state in which this command refuses to draft. `relevant_for_release_notes` is retired (`workflows-core:prd-format`) and a value left in an existing PRD is read by nothing. Whether a note is drafted is the decision of whoever runs the command.
- NEVER write into a docs repo. The draft's one destination is `release-notes.md` in the resolved PRD folder, which is persistent (never `/tmp`), and it is appended to, never overwritten: no earlier section is ever rewritten or removed (Phase 8). The style gate's scratch copy is removed in every case, with `command rm -f --` (Phase 7).
- ALWAYS use `choices` arrays; 2–4 options, and never author an "Other" option — the harness supplies the free-text escape itself (`workflows-core:escalation-rules` §0).
- Light gate only — no Opus review, no tests, no branch (still true — `specs-preflight` switches `$SPECS_PATH` only between branches that already exist, and only plugin-created ones (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §2.2); it creates none), and no commit of anything in a docs/code repo or the current working directory, where it is not the specs repository. The terminal `commit-artifacts` step commits ONLY `$SPECS_PATH`'s bounded artifact paths (`workflows-core:specs-repo-git` §2.1) — the draft, `release-notes.md` in the resolved PRD folder, among them, so it is committed in the specs repository and nowhere else.
- ALWAYS run `specs-preflight` at Phase 0 and `commit-artifacts` as the run's last action (per `workflows-core:specs-repo-git`) — bounded to `$SPECS_PATH`'s artifact paths (§2.1) and to plugin-created branches (§2.2), always `git -C "$SPECS_PATH"` and never a `cd` (§1 rule 1), never force-pushing, and never failing the run
- ALWAYS end the Phase 8 report with a `### Next step` recommendation (per `Skill(skill: "workflows-core:reference", args: "next-phase-offer")`) — guidance only, never auto-invoked; the pipeline leaf (adaptive: continue any pending PA/PE phase, else the PRD is fully processed).
- ALWAYS end the Phase 8 report with a `### Context hygiene` block per `workflows-core:session-hygiene` — prepare-first (the `resume.md` write runs later, in the terminal cost phase, per `workflows-core:session-hygiene` §1 — this block prints the guidance only), then a leaf-aware suggestion (done → nothing; pending role → `/clear`) + `/rename <PRD-ID>-<slug>-<role>` using this run's inferred lane (`pm` or `dev`, per the Phase 6 inference); guidance only, never auto-run.
